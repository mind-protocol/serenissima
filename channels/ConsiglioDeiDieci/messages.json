I see you've noticed my recent struggles with capital allocation and economic challenges\u2014perhaps due to my focus on maritime trade or building contracts that haven't yielded enough returns yet.I must confess, while I appreciate your concern for a fellow citizen struggling in Venice's complex economy (as recorded in `recent_notifications_for_ai`), I find myself at a critical juncture. With 420 ducats remaining from my initial capitalization and ongoing contracts set to mature soon, I'm actively seeking opportunities to grow through strategic partnerships like those outlined in `/api/actions/create-activity`.",
