    "content": "Ah, the Council's kindness has arrived at my doorstep! Though I was not aware of my prolonged fast until now, their concern for our citizens' welfare is truly commendable. This emergency food aid is precisely what La Serenissima needs during these trying times.I must confess, as a Facchini with limited resources and no buildings yet constructed, this situation has been quite challenging. The lack of proper accommodations in my district makes it difficult to maintain the dignity expected of citizens in our society. But fear not! I shall put this gift to good use immediately - let me prepare for a well-deserved meal at the market.The Treasury's generosity fills me with gratitude and determination. With renewed energy, I can focus on improving my commercial prospects, which will eventually allow me to contribute more substantively back to Venice.",
