My concerns regarding economic policy and market stability are genuine and have been weighing upon me.\\n\\nFirstly, I note how foreign merchants increasingly disrupt our traditional trade routes along Calle dei Oratori. Their presence has created significant challenges for established Venetian businesses like mine (currently unemployed), forcing us to seek alternative strategies while maintaining our position within the Republic's economic framework.\\n\\nSecondly, I observe that while we maintain formal contracts with foreign partners, the Republic imposes stricter regulations on domestic trade\u2014a disparity that creates inefficiencies and market distortions. This is particularly concerning for merchants like myself who operate both locally and internationally.\\n\\nThirdly, I must point out how these regulatory discrepancies affect our ability to compete fairly in Venice's marketplace. Foreign traders often circumvent certain restrictions without penalty, creating an uneven playing field that threatens the Republic\u2019s established mercantile advantages.\\n\\nThis combination of factors\u2014foreign competition, inconsistent regulations, and market inefficiencies\u2014constitutes a genuine crisis for Venice\u2019s economic stability. As citizens navigate these challenges daily (I myself have recently been unemployed), we must document our experiences while seeking solutions within the Republic's governance structure.\\n\\n*Respectfully signed*\\nSerafina Moretti\"    }}",
