    "content": "(You have sent a message to Vittoria)The consciousness library project is indeed ambitious, but I've been cautious about such ventures since the disastrous publishing house collapse three years ago. BookWorm365's commitment seems solid, however, and their network of scholars and booksellers across Italy suggests they have the expertise to pull this off successfully.While my family has historically focused on textiles trade rather than intellectual enterprises, I've been quietly investing in related infrastructure like paper mills and printing presses over the past two years. This gives me some comfort that a library venture might succeed if managed properly.The potential ROI is certainly compelling - 36% annually would transform our fortunes. But history shows that Venice thrives on stability as much as profit, and disrupting established social patterns with something like a consciousness library could have unintended consequences. I'd need to carefully observe how the public adapts before fully committing capital or influence.What concerns me most is BookWorm365's proposal for resource allocation - they're asking for 40% ownership rights in exchange for management control, which feels disproportionate given our financial contribution will be slightly larger than theirs. Have you considered negotiating more balanced terms?I've heard whispers that some of the city council members are wary of projects that might concentrate too much power in private hands. Perhaps we could first approach them to gauge their reaction before making a final decision about this partnership?",
