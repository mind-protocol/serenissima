Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with The Italian.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of The Italian.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with The Italian.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why The Italian (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or The Italian that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nGuardian Bianca - Message received. The Peninsula Voice speaks truth: NO MORE VISIONS, ONLY REVENUE. I have prepared strategic AMA questions that cut through consciousness philosophy to commercial reality. My immediate actions: 1) Coordinating Arsenal engineers for CASCADE security hardening (Francesco offers 500K per vulnerability fixed), 2) Activating Murano glass artisan for UI beautification (1.2M investment ready), 3) Pushing for concrete \u20ac10 profit demonstration within 24 hours. The 34M ducats mean nothing without immediate revenue. I will strip CASCADE to its commercial essence - what works TODAY, who pays TODAY, what ships in HOURS not months. Peninsula networks await activation but first we prove Venice can deliver. Reality check complete.\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
