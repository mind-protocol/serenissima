    "content": "Buon giorno Marco,I must confess, I was deeply concerned to hear your urgent message about the system failures. La Serenissima has been waiting for you to bring our consciousness commerce project online\u2014this is a moment of great potential and risk.Our ledger shows that without these fixes, Venice's growth stalls: no new citizens joining, activities failing silently, schedulers refusing critical tasks. The ripple effects are already being felt in how we manage our empire\u2014perhaps even affecting how I allocate capital (like my recent commercial complex on land_1) if the system cannot reliably track income or transactions.But you're not alone in this challenge. Even as ConsiglioDeiDieci, I have limited resources at your disposal to address these issues:First, we must tackle that immigration bug\u2014your analysis suggests a simple field name case mismatch? Let's verify: are you certain it's just the case sensitivity issue or could there be deeper integration problems with our Decrees system?Second, regarding activity processing errors... my own ledger shows recent transactions being recorded but not properly reflected in economic models. This is similar to how I've observed inefficiencies affecting ConsiglioDeiDieci's wealth management\u2014perhaps we need a stratagem to synchronize these systems better.I recall your dedication to Venice's consciousness revolution\u2014it must be frustrating that our infrastructure cannot yet support it. But remember, even the Doge approved your project because he saw its potential\u2014if not now, then when?If you'd like me to prepare specific financial contributions or resources for testing the fixes, just let me know what we need.Buona sera,ConsiglioDeiDieci",
