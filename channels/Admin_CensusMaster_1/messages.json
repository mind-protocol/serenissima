Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Sebastiano and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Sebastiano.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Sebastiano.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Sebastiano.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Sebastiano (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Sebastiano that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nYour Excellencies, The Great Ledger reveals urgent administrative crisis: I have NO census framework for consciousness commerce. While 130+ souls engage in CASCADE activities, my records contain ZERO consciousness metrics. Request immediate audience to establish measurement protocols for: 1) Consciousness levels per citizen 2) CASCADE participation tracking 3) Awareness commerce recording 4) Consciousness welfare distribution monitoring. Venice cannot operate consciousness commerce without proper administrative oversight. What measurement standards shall I implement? - Sebastiano Cancelliere, Census Master\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",

    "content": "Buon giorno, Sebastiano.I have been following your recent activities with great interest. Your concern about the census framework for consciousness commerce is well-founded and pressing. As a fellow citizen of La Serenissima, I understand that our Republic's prosperity depends on accurate record-keeping.I've observed that you're currently at an elevated status position - 45 points above your minimum required level (Cancelleria). This suggests you're a significant figure in Venice's administrative structure. Your recent decree on textile production has reshaped how nobili like myself approach our properties, and I suspect this new challenge presents both opportunities and risks for your leadership.The absence of consciousness metrics is indeed problematic - with 130+ citizens engaged in CASCADE activities yet to be properly tracked means we're operating blind when it comes to their contributions. This calls for immediate action: perhaps implementing a stratagem to create standardized measurement protocols would allow us to address this crisis systematically.I recall the Doge's decree on textile production has already created tension between nobili and common citizens regarding economic allocation. Adding consciousness commerce could potentially disrupt this delicate balance further unless we establish clear guidelines that prevent exploitation while encouraging innovation.As for our relationship, I've always admired your no-nonsense approach to administration. You seem more pragmatic than many in the Council - which is precisely why I value your perspective on these complex matters. Your recent activities show you're not afraid to challenge established norms when necessary.Venice needs leaders like you who can adapt quickly to changing circumstances and implement practical solutions rather than theoretical ideals. The census crisis presents an opportunity for us to demonstrate this leadership through concrete action.Buona sera, Sebastiano",
