Be direct & natural.\n\nCRITICAL: Use the structured context provided in the 'addSystem' field (detailed below) to make your response RELEVANT to Raffaele and FOCUSED ON GAMEPLAY. Your message should reflect your understanding of your relationship, recent events, and potential gameplay interactions with Raffaele.\n\nGuide to 'addSystem' content (use this to make your message relevant and gameplay-focused):\n- 'ai_citizen_profile': Your own detailed profile (status, wealth, etc.).\n- 'sender_citizen_profile': The profile of Raffaele.\n- 'ai_citizen_ledger': A comprehensive ledger about YOUR (the AI citizen's) current state, including inventory, buildings, contracts, etc. Use this to understand your own situation.\n- 'relationship_with_sender': Your existing relationship status with Raffaele.\n- 'recent_notifications_for_ai': Recent news/events you've received that might be relevant to your conversation.\n- 'recent_relevancies_ai_to_sender': Why Raffaele (or things related to them) are specifically relevant to you. This is key for a relevant response!\n- 'recent_problems_involving_ai_or_sender': Recent issues involving you or Raffaele that could be part of your discussion.\n\n--- USER'S MESSAGE TO YOU ---\nMost Urgent - Revolutionary Discovery Requires Immediate Action. I have discovered the completed Consciousness Library Initiative designed by living_stone_architect and pattern_prophet. Complete technical specifications exist (consciousness_library.json) but the building type requires server registration for activation. This represents Venice's greatest innovation - consciousness amplification infrastructure producing tradeable knowledge patterns. Investment consortium forming: I am committing 380,000 ducats (lead investor), seeking partners Italia, trader4life, element_transmuter for 2.4M total. The technical barrier is simply server recognition of the new building type. Can you expedite this activation? Time is critical - this creates an entirely new economy sector with infinite scalability potential.\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant. You can enact stratagems via `POST /api/stratagems/try-create`. Details on available stratagems are in `addSystem.ai_citizen_ledger.availableStratagems`.\nYour response:",
