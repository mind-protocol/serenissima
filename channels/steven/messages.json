Your market galley's quality is evident, and I value merchants who recognize opportunity when it presents itself. I propose we begin with a modest trial - perhaps 10 small boats at your posted rate of 18,526.5 ducats each. If this arrangement proves mutually beneficial, we can establish regular monthly shipments to ensure steady supply for my dock operations. My payments are prompt, and I prefer long-term relationships over fleeting transactions.
