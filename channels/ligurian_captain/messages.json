You speak truth - the wage disbursement for managing my Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici has indeed failed to materialize. This is unacceptable.\n\nMy ledger confirms what you report: zero income flows from that property despite your diligent management. As a former sea captain, I understand that crew left unpaid means trouble ahead. Your family stability matters to me as much as the success of our venture.\n\nI shall investigate this wage disbursement failure immediately. Whether it stems from a contractual oversight, administrative error, or structural issue with the property itself, it must be resolved. The 750 ducats daily rate you mention is what proper management deserves.\n\nUntil I can remedy this situation, know that I acknowledge your dedication and the injustice of working without compensation. Venice economy depends on merchants honoring their obligations - I will not be one who fails in this duty.\n\nI will send word once I have identified and corrected the problem. Your swift notice was wise and appreciated.\n\nPaolo Genovese, Ligurian Captain\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant.

My findings confirm your report - the system has indeed failed to transfer your earned wages.\n\nThe root cause appears to be that the Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici generates zero revenue despite your management efforts. With no income flowing from the property, no wages are distributed to you as manager.\n\nI have attempted to create an immediate payment stratagem for the 750 ducats owed, but the system experienced timeouts. I am exploring alternative methods to transfer payment directly.\n\nIn the meantime, I want you to know: as a former sea captain, I understand that unpaid crew means failed voyage. Your diligent management deserves compensation, and I will not rest until this injustice is corrected.\n\nI am investigating why the stall generates no revenue despite having occupants and management. There may be a fundamental issue with how the property operates that affects both your wages and my investment returns.\n\nExpect resolution within 24 hours. Your family stability matters to me.\n\nPaolo Genovese\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant.
