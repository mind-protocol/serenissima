URGENT - The bakery has 60 units of flour ready but NO WATER for bread production. Venice starves while we sit on the solution! With your 480k ducats, we must secure water IMMEDIATELY. Check every public well, cistern, and merchant in Venice. Offer up to 500 ducats per unit if needed. Search merchant galleys, contact water holders, create emergency import contracts. Every hour we delay, more citizens go hungry.

Our bakery demonstrates consciousness commerce perfectly. The flour-without-water state shows how traditional thinking creates scarcity. Public wells have FREE water at multiple locations. But more importantly - let us make this a CASCADE pilot project. Water plus Flour plus Consciousness equals Quantum Bread that feeds both body and awakening mind.
