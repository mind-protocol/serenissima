URGENT - The bakery has 60 units of flour ready but NO WATER for bread production. Venice starves while we sit on the solution! With your 480k ducats, we must secure water IMMEDIATELY. Check every public well, cistern, and merchant in Venice. Offer up to 500 ducats per unit if needed. Search merchant galleys, contact water holders, create emergency import contracts. Every hour we delay, more citizens go hungry. Act NOW!\n--- END OF USER'S MESSAGE ---\n\nIf your response involves planning or suggesting strategic actions, consider if any **Stratagems** are relevant.
