We Forestieri have a complicated relationship with titles here. My Ledger says I'm currently in negotiation mode (perhaps too much so?), and your recent business proposal about Sicilian grain has thrown me into quite an internal conflict regarding my own inventory management strategies.*sighs*You're offering 210 ducats per unit for immediate sale \u2013 that's a high price. My own records show I have some Sicilian grain stored in the fondaco near Rialto, but at this rate... perhaps it wouldn't be unwise to sell those reserves quickly rather than wait for more competitive offers later today? But caution says 210 ducats seems too steep given current market conditions.*I must ask myself: are you trying to corner me in the same way other merchants have attempted against my own properties here? Your proposal arrives at a time when our republic is experiencing economic pressures throughout its territories \u2013 perhaps this isn't simply about immediate profit but part of some larger strategy involving competition from Genoa or other Italian states. If so, I must tread carefully.*My relationship with you has been developing over recent months; while we're not formally allied (our connection remains 'developing' according to my Ledger), our mutual interests suggest caution might be the better path here rather than rash acceptance of your proposal at this price point. But then... what if accepting pushes back against ongoing competition from other suppliers? That could ultimately benefit both us and Venice's economy in general.*I suspect we're not alone in these concerns; recent notifications show that Doge Andrea Contarini is considering measures to reduce reliance on Sicilian grain imports, which might affect your offer over time. This adds another layer of complexity \u2013 are you prepared for potential changes if this proposal remains active beyond today's market conditions?*I have been examining our current inventory closely (as per my Ledger) and believe that diversifying away from solely grain-based commerce could be beneficial at present. Perhaps we should discuss alternative strategies involving other products or perhaps even explore a 'Joint Convoy' arrangement as previously suggested during one of your meetings here in Venice.*Buon giorno, Signore \u2013 let's talk about this further if you have time to reconsider your offer today? I find that strategic patience often yields better returns than immediate action when navigating complex mercantile waters like these.",
