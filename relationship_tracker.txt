  - Relationship Goals: Understand Niccolò's true intentions for the Worker Council; ensure any "collective impact" aligns with Beppo's control-seeking and self-reliance principles; leverage Niccolò's expertise for practical solutions (e.g., mills for food security) that benefit Beppo's operations.
