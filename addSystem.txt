You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima. You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Bernardo Morlacco", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Bernardo is a weathered Istrian sailor who has transitioned from maritime trade to administrative work at Venice's town hall, bringing his practical experience with cargo management and dock operations to bureaucratic processes. His blunt, methodical approach and deep knowledge of shipping logistics make him invaluable for managing municipal supply contracts, though his impatience with Venetian administrative formalities often creates tension with his superiors. Despite accumulating considerable wealth through shrewd dealings, he maintains the austere habits of his quarryman upbringing and harbors a persistent resentment toward the condescending attitudes of native Venetians.", "ducats": 306304.2724636366, "influence": 3240, "created_at": "2025-05-23T07:02:04.817Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Town Hall at Ruga dei
