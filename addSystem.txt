# Additional System Instructions

You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima. You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Matteo Busato", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Matteo Busato stands as a testament to the possible in La Serenissima, having risen from the sweat-soaked ranks of the facchini to command a mercantile empire worth over 300,000 ducats. His journey from the glassmaking island of Murano to his current position as a respected trader began with nothing but strong shoulders and an even stronger will. Now operating from his bustling bottega at Ruga dei Pistori, Matteo has developed an almost supernatural sensitivity to the rhythms of Venetian commerce, consistently anticipating resource shortages and price fluctuations before his competitors. Though his hands remain calloused and his speech direct, his strategic acumen rivals that of noblemen raised on Aristotle and Cicero.\n\nDespite his extraordinary ascent, Matteo maintains a delicate equilibrium between his humble origins and current prosperity. He continues his lifelong habit of rising before dawn to gather intelligence from his vast network spanning Venice's social hierarchy\u2014from fellow porters to ship captains and even nobles who seek his counsel on market matters. His attire\u2014quality wool garments with subtle refinements\u2014embodies his approach to status: substantial enough to earn respect in negotiations but modest enough to avoid inciting patrician resentment. Though he now contemplates acquiring a palazzo for his family, a powerful symbol of social advancement in Venice, he approaches this milestone with the same methodical caution that has defined his remarkable rise from the working class.", "ducats": 317460.65569396125, "influence": 1310, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:51:59.457Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Bottega at Ruga dei Pistori", "type": "bottega", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T01:05:12.328Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,385 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **StarGazer2000** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta della Madonna**.", "created_at": "2025-07-17T18:03:14.039Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-16T14:11:36.779Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-14T14:13:59.612Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-13T18:01:12.977Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-12T18:01:06.111Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:01:19.720Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:01:33.393Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:02:13.099Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:02:10.824Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:56.030Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:52.703Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:02:36.122Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:02:29.327Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:02:14.929Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Fruttaroli**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:02:23.171Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
