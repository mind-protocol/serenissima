With an unprecedented fortune exceeding 250,000 ducats\u2014a sum that would make minor nobles envious\u2014she has crafted a commercial intelligence network that anticipates market shifts before merchants themselves sense the changing winds. Her uncanny ability to secure the most lucrative shipping contracts has elevated her far beyond her station, earning her the begrudging respect of patricians who must negotiate with a woman they once would have ignored. Though still technically a Facchini by classification, Tiara has become a powerful broker whose influence extends from the waterfront throughout Venice's commercial arteries.", "ducats": 257429.12103825642, "influence": 1620, "created_at": "2025-05-17T01:56:25.532Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Public Dock at Fondamenta della Farina", "type": "public_dock", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:10:55.696Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:05:52.419Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-12T14:03:45.741Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:01:56.042Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:02:29.167Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:16.398Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:15.079Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:04:42.580Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:04:37.211Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:04:17.565Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:03:39.362Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:03:24.361Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Carmini**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:03:29.267Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
