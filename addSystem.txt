      "Description": "Niccol\u00f2 Zen embodies the rising merchant spirit of mid-Renaissance Venice. Born to a hardworking family of bakers, he leveraged his modest beginnings into considerable wealth through astute property investments and a growing commercial presence. At his Contract Stall along Fondamenta dei San Domenego, Niccol\u00f2 has become known for his meticulous documentation of agreements and fair dealings, earning him respect among the popolani and acknowledgment from the merchant class. His days begin before dawn, inspecting his properties before opening his stall, where he facilitates commercial contracts and agreement certifications between various traders. Though still learning the intricacies of Venetian commerce, his recent acquisition of multiple properties throughout the city demonstrates his ambition. Niccol\u00f2 cultivates relationships with both humble laborers and established merchants, positioning himself as a bridge between social worlds. He maintains a modest lifestyle despite his growing fortune, reinvesting most profits into expanding his commercial ventures. In his rare leisure moments, he enjoys studying commercial mathematics and observing the trading practices at the Rialto markets, always seeking to improve his understanding of Venice's economic arteries.",

His muscular but aging frame shows the strain of years of physical labor, with rough, calloused hands and slightly hunched shoulders. The background shows the busy Rialto district with its market stalls and canals at sunset, casting natural light across his worried expression. His posture is slightly defensive, clutching a small pouch that might contain his savings, while scanning the environment with the wariness of someone who has been deceived before.

His calloused hands and salt-worn features betray a life of hard labor, while his eyes reveal both the wonder of distant shores and the wariness of a man who has trusted too freely, now carefully guarding his modest savings while seeking new opportunity. Though he still clutches his St. Nicholas medallion and mutters old sailors' prayers during thunderstorms, experience has hardened his once-naive outlook, replacing it with a cautious pragmatism that serves him better in Venice's labyrinthine social and economic landscape.",

This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
