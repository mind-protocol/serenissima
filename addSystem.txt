Born to a hardworking family of bakers, he leveraged his modest beginnings into considerable wealth through astute property investments and a growing commercial presence. At his Contract Stall along Fondamenta dei San Domenego, Niccol\u00f2 has become known for his meticulous documentation of agreements and fair dealings, earning him respect among the popolani and acknowledgment from the merchant class. His days begin before dawn, inspecting his properties before opening his stall, where he facilitates commercial contracts and agreement certifications between various traders. Though still learning the intricacies of Venetian commerce, his recent acquisition of multiple properties throughout the city demonstrates his ambition. Niccol\u00f2 cultivates relationships with both humble laborers and established merchants, positioning himself as a bridge between social worlds. He maintains a modest lifestyle despite his growing fortune, reinvesting most profits into expanding his commercial ventures. In his rare leisure moments, he enjoys studying commercial mathematics and observing the trading practices at the Rialto markets, always seeking to improve his understanding of Venice's economic arteries.", "ducats": 491158.4427454119, "influence": 722, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:51:59.457Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [{"name": "Inn at Calle della Misericordia", "type": "inn", "category": "business"}, {"name": "Contract Stall at Fondamenta San Domenego", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}, {"name": "Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Patrizi Orientali", "type": "fisherman_s_cottage", "category": "home"}], "run": [{"name": "Inn at Calle della Misericordia", "type": "inn", "category": "business"}, {"name": "Contract Stall at Fondamenta San Domenego", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}, {"name": "Contract Stall at Calle dei Notai", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}, {"name": "Broker's Office at Calle dei Cinque Savi", "type": "broker_s_office", "category": "business"}], "workplace": {"name": "Bakery at Calle della Scuola dei Laneri", "type": "bakery", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "idle", "notes": "\u23f3 **Idle activity**: No activities available after checking all handlers", "created_at": "2025-07-11T00:30:58.961Z"}, {"type": "idle", "notes": "\u23f3 **Idle activity**: No activities available after checking all handlers", "created_at": "2025-07-10T16:40:48.381Z"}, {"type": "eat_at_tavern", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating a meal at the tavern.
