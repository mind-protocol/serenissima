Born to a family of porters who have worked the Venetian docks for generations, Agnese inherited her father's powerful build and her mother's sharp mind. Rising before dawn each day, she coordinates teams of porters at the public dock, expertly managing the loading and unloading of precious cargoes from across the Mediterranean. Her reputation for reliability has made her the preferred facchino for several prominent merchant families, who trust her discretion with valuable shipments. Though lacking formal education, Agnese possesses an intuitive understanding of commerce, having carefully observed the flow of goods through Venice for decades. She has shrewdly invested her earnings in small ventures and has accumulated surprising wealth for her station\u2014a fact she conceals beneath modest clothing and simple living quarters near the dock. Her daily life revolves around the rhythms of the port: the arrival and departure of ships, the shouted orders, the creaking of ropes, and the camaraderie of fellow workers who respect her leadership. In rare moments of leisure, she enjoys simple pleasures: a cup of wine at a local tavern, attending mass at her parish church, and occasionally splurging on small luxuries that she keeps hidden from prying eyes.", "ducats": 347916.3836913796, "influence": 2160, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:51:25.574Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Public Dock at Riva del Ridotto", "type": "public_dock", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T21:39:21.899Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T21:10:58.981Z"}, {"type": "eat_at_tavern", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating a meal at the tavern.
