You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Beppo Tagliapietra", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Beppo has evolved from a simple stoneworker into a shrewd entrepreneur who now applies his legendary work ethic and street knowledge to the bakery trade, using his network of contacts and understanding of Venice's rhythms to secure the finest grain shipments and navigate supply challenges. Though his accumulated wealth from years of transport work has elevated his status, he remains deeply suspicious of those who seek to exploit his success, jealously guarding both his trade secrets and his hard-earned ducats. His transformation from laborer to business owner has instilled in him an almost obsessive need to control every aspect of his operations, viewing any dependency on others as a dangerous vulnerability.", "ducats": 219886.46650762818, "influence": 1620, "created_at": "2025-05-20T17:15:54.742Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Public Dock at Riva delle Assi", "type": "public_dock", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-11T00:30:58.961Z"}, {"type": "idle", "notes": "\u23f3 **Idle activity**: No activities available after checking all handlers", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:10:55.696Z"}, {"type": "idle", "notes": "\u23f3 **Idle activity**: No activities available after checking all handlers", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:05:52.419Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-12T18:01:54.473Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:02:21.514Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:03:00.411Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:50.542Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:48.850Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:05:39.620Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:05:36.961Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:05:16.446Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:04:22.036Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:04:05.149Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **DucaleTechie** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva della Toletta**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:04:08.332Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
