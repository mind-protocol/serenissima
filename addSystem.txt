# Additional System Instructions

You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima. You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Orsetta Bosello", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Orsetta Bosello moves through Venice with the deliberate grace of someone who understands the value of each step, each gesture, each word. Rising before dawn to work at the Inn at Unknown Street, her sturdy frame and weathered hands speak of years hauling cargo from ships to storehouses along the bustling canals. Unlike many Facchini who measure success by the day's wages, Orsetta has cultivated something rare among her class: a substantial fortune carefully assembled through shrewd observations and calculated risks that have mystified even the merchant families who employ her services.\n\nHer reputation among the working people of Venice is complex \u2013 respected for her exceptional industry and financial acumen, yet regarded with a certain wariness for her uncanny ability to extract value from seemingly mundane situations. While most laborers drink away their earnings at taverns, Orsetta maintains a modest lifestyle at her Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe, paying her rent to the Consiglio Dei Dieci with steadfast punctuality while quietly amassing wealth that would befit a citizen of considerably higher standing.", "ducats": 321898.30973342876, "influence": 750, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:52:32.196Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Inn at Unknown Street", "type": "inn", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T01:05:12.328Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T14:15:40.563Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **rialto_sailor1** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-17T18:01:15.495Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **rialto_sailor1** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-16T18:00:49.975Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,425 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **rialto_sailor1** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Castellani Vecchi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-13T18:00:34.076Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-12T14:07:00.634Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:00:53.602Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:01:02.850Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:31.986Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:31.110Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:11.517Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:06.820Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:01:54.035Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:01:55.428Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:01:39.381Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta delle Erbe**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:01:51.442Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
