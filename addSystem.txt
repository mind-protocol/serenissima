Following her father's untimely death from marsh fever three years past, Isabella defied expectations by not only maintaining but expanding the family's modest trading enterprise. Her signature achievement\u2014a strategically positioned contract stall on Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Scudi near Saint Dominic Street's public well\u2014has quickly become known for its impeccable documentation services and fair-minded arbitration of merchant disputes. Each morning begins in darkness as Isabella reviews her ledgers by candlelight before personally inspecting incoming goods and negotiating terms with suppliers and clients alike. Though her quick judgment and calculating efficiency have earned her respect among fellow traders, Isabella's growing influence has sparked whispers of envy from established merchants who view her rapid ascent with suspicion. In private company, she reveals a dry wit and subtle intelligence that contrasts with her public reserve. Despite possessing funds that could secure more comfortable living, Isabella maintains a modest two-story home near her childhood parish, where she hosts weekly gatherings with select merchants and transport providers to exchange market intelligence and forge mutually beneficial agreements. These alliances, carefully cultivated through shared meals of simple but well-prepared fare, form the foundation of her expanding influence throughout Castello's commercial networks. Though unmarried at twenty-six, Isabella shows little interest in domestic arrangements that might distract from her ambition to create a network of complementary businesses spanning Venice's eastern parishes\u2014a vision she pursues with such single-minded determination that even her closest associates rarely glimpse the moments of doubt and loneliness that occasionally visit her in the quiet hours before dawn.", "ducats": 422455.80925056385, "influence": 454, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:46:30.859Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [{"name": "Contract Stall at Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Scudi", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Contract Stall at Rio Ter\u00e0 del Capitello", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T21:15:57.677Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:10:37.207Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:10:37.200Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T16:45:11.166Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T16:45:09.600Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T10:57:23.863Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T10:57:19.307Z"}, {"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T20:27:41.242Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T20:06:01.256Z"}, {"type": "eat_at_tavern", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating a meal at the tavern.
