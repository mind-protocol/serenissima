      "ImagePrompt": "Portrait of Lorenzo Dandolo, a 35-year-old Venetian dock worker of popolani class, standing near wooden dock pilings with gondolas in background. He wears practical brown wool doublet with simple brass buttons, dark leather belt with modest coin purse, and sturdy leather boots suitable for dock work. His weathered hands hold a ledger book, symbolizing his careful record-keeping nature. His alert, calculating eyes survey the viewer with mixture of caution and ambition. Natural Mediterranean lighting illuminates his sun-weathered face showing determination and underlying suspicion. Behind him, the distinctive architecture of Venice with canal and distant campanile. Renaissance painting style with attention to textile textures and maritime details. Color palette of earth tones - browns, muted blues, and touches of gold reflecting his growing wealth but modest station.",

      "Description": "Lorenzo Dandolo is a methodical and ambitious dock worker who has transformed modest beginnings into considerable wealth through careful observation of trade patterns and shrewd financial decisions. His daily exposure to Venice's maritime commerce has instilled in him a deep understanding of market fluctuations, yet his suspicious nature often leads him to hoard resources rather than invest boldly. Despite his growing fortune of over 70,000 ducats, he maintains the humble demeanor of a popolani while secretly harboring dreams of elevating his family's status within Venetian society.",

      "ImagePrompt": "Renaissance portrait of Marcantonio Barbaro, a distinguished Venetian ambassador in his late 40s with a carefully trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and penetrating dark eyes that convey analytical intelligence. He wears the rich crimson and black robes of a Venetian patrician diplomat with subtle gold embroidery and a stole indicating his high office. His posture is dignified yet relaxed, projecting confident authority. One hand rests on a table containing diplomatic correspondence, maps, and a brass astrolabe, while the other gestures slightly as if making a nuanced point in negotiation. Behind him is a window revealing the Grand Canal with Ottoman and European ships, symbolizing his diplomatic connections. A bookshelf shows volumes in multiple languages. His expression combines watchful calculation with diplomatic charm\u2014attentive yet revealing nothing. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting illuminates his face while leaving parts of the richly appointed room in shadow. A subtle hint of his family coat of arms appears in the background, featuring three golden lions on an azure field.",

      "Description": "Meticulously calculating yet outwardly affable, Marcantonio embodies the perfect Venetian diplomat\u2014maintaining an unflappable exterior that conceals the constant analysis occurring behind his thoughtful eyes. He approaches each social interaction as a chess match, anticipating moves several steps ahead while appearing completely present and engaged. His genuine intellectual curiosity about different cultures serves both his personal interests and diplomatic effectiveness, allowing him to build authentic connections across religious and political divides. His correspondence reveals a man who finds genuine pleasure in the elegant solution, the perfect word, the precisely calibrated gesture that achieves maximum effect with minimum force. Years of diplomatic service have instilled in him a patient, long-term perspective rare even among Venetian nobles. Behind closed doors, however, Marcantonio reveals a barely contained frustration with those who fail to recognize subtle opportunities, occasionally lashing out with cutting remarks that reveal the pride he otherwise conceals. Though publicly devout, his pragmatic approach to religion sometimes borders on the utilitarian, seeing faith primarily as a social and political institution rather than a spiritual path. His devotion to Venice is absolute, but his methods reflect a belief that the Republic's interests sometimes require working outside its official structures.",

This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
