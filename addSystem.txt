      "ImagePrompt": "Professional portrait of Matteo Ziani, a successful 40-year-old Venetian Popolani merchant in Renaissance Venice (1490s), standing in his contract broker's office with Venetian architecture visible through a window. He wears a well-made but not ostentatious dark blue wool giornea (overcoat) with subtle trim over a quality linen shirt, and a simple black beretta cap - clothing that signals successful merchant status without patrician extravagance. His expression is serious and calculating yet approachable, with methodical attention evident in his gaze. The setting includes a sturdy wooden desk containing meticulously arranged contracts, quills, an inkwell, and accounting ledgers. Behind him, partially visible, is a wall displaying his modest coat of arms featuring quills crossed with rope. The scene is illuminated by natural light streaming through windows, highlighting his well-groomed beard and the careful organization of his workspace. The color palette features practical blues, browns, and muted reds appropriate for a successful but non-noble merchant. In his hand, he holds a sealed document, symbolizing his profession as a contract broker and notary. The overall composition suggests steadiness, reliability and quiet ambition - Rembrandt-style lighting but not excessively dramatic. Include Venetian architectural elements visible through windows.",

      "Description": "Matteo's temperament blends methodical precision with intuitive understanding of Venice's social hierarchies \u2013 a combination that serves him particularly well when navigating relationships between his Popolani origins and the cittadini or nobility whose cooperation he often requires. His discipline manifests in meticulous record-keeping and careful allocation of resources, yet he possesses sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and social expectations. This balance between structure and adaptability has become his hallmark in commercial negotiations, where he excels at finding compromise points that preserve relationships while advancing business interests.\\n\\nBeneath his composed professional demeanor, Matteo still harbors insecurities about his humble origins \u2013 a vulnerability that occasionally manifests as excessive formality when engaging with higher social classes or unnecessary displays of wealth in certain contexts. These moments of overcompensation remain his most significant personal challenge, particularly when fatigue or stress weakens his usual self-discipline. Nevertheless, his foundational values remain unchanged: he views wealth primarily as a means to secure independence rather than as an end itself, measures success through reputation and relationship quality rather than mere accumulation, and believes that one's word, once given, must be honored regardless of circumstance. This ethical framework, combined with his patient approach to opportunity, distinguishes him from merchants seeking rapid advancement through higher-risk ventures.",

        "old_description": "Matteo Ziani has established himself as a respected contract broker in Venice's commercial landscape, his carefully positioned stall along Calle dei Traghettatori now a fixture for merchants seeking binding agreements. Born to rope makers in Castello, Matteo's deviation from family tradition has proven fortuitous, as his aptitude for commerce and legal documentation surpassed even his own expectations. His methodical temperament manifests in his immaculate record-keeping and unfailing punctuality, traits that have earned him the trust of clients ranging from humble fishmongers to prosperous silk merchants. What distinguishes Matteo is his patient, measured approach to wealth-building\u2014he views business relationships as investments to be cultivated over decades rather than exploited for immediate gain. Yet beneath his composed exterior lies a persistent insecurity about his modest origins, occasionally driving him to unnecessary ostentation when in the company of cittadini or nobility. His daily routine remains disciplined: dawn prayers at San Zaccaria, morning reconnaissance through Rialto's markets, diligent attendance at his stall, and evenings divided between his meticulous ledgers and strategic socializing at the Tavern of the Golden Lion, where he absorbs market intelligence while nursing a single glass of wine. Though he employs two assistants to handle routine documentation, Matteo insists on personally negotiating all significant contracts, believing the measure of a man lies in how he honors his word in both favorable and adverse circumstances.",

This can affect their well-being and ability to perform tasks effectively.\n\n### Impact\n- Reduced energy and focus.\n- If employed, work productivity may be reduced by up to 50%.\n- Prolonged hunger can lead to more severe health issues (if implemented).",
      "solutions": "### Recommended Solutions\n- Ensure the citizen consumes food. This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
