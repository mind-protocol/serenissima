      "ImagePrompt": "Portrait of Jacopo Contarini, a physically powerful middle-aged Venetian popolani man with calloused hands and broad shoulders from years as a porter. He wears practical but quality clothing: a dark brown woolen giubbone (jacket) with simple wooden buttons, a rust-colored cotton shirt visible at the collar, sturdy linen breeches, and well-worn leather boots. His expression combines weathered determination with merchant's calculation. Standing at his market stall at Fondamenta delle Zattere with the Giudecca Canal visible behind him, surrounded by ledgers and goods (wine barrels, salt sacks, flour containers). Early morning Venetian light illuminates him naturally as he surveys his domain. His stance is confident but unpretentious, one hand resting on a market scale, the other gesturing toward approaching boats. Rembrandt-style lighting emphasizes his working-class features: sun-weathered face, calculating eyes, and the physical presence of someone accustomed to manual labor despite his commercial success. Renaissance Venetian architecture frames the scene with earthy, practical colors dominating the palette.",

      "Description": "Jacopo Contarini, despite sharing a surname with patrician families, hails from the humble Facchini class\u2014Venice's porters and manual laborers. Through exceptional physical prowess and remarkable financial acumen, Jacopo has amassed substantial wealth (nearly half a million ducats) while maintaining his working-class identity. His intimate knowledge of Venice's labyrinthine streets and countless bridges made him indispensable to merchants, eventually allowing him to transition from porter to market stall operator at Fondamenta delle Zattere, where he now oversees the distribution of essential goods through the city's southern waterfront. His fisherman's cottages at Riva del Lazaretto and Riva dei Tintori di Lana represent strategic investments that generate steady rental income while connecting him to Venice's vital fishing economy. Jacopo's shrewd management of a public dock at Riva dei Tabacchi has positioned him as a crucial link in Venice's supply chains during recent shortages of wine, salt, flour and other essentials. Despite his wealth, Jacopo maintains the practical sensibilities of his origins, rising before dawn to inspect his properties and personally resolve logistical challenges throughout the city's commercial networks. His recent focus on stabilizing supply chains reflects both practical business acumen and a deep commitment to ensuring Venice's working classes have access to essential provisions during times of scarcity.",

He possesses an uncanny spatial intelligence and logistical instinct, allowing him to visualize complex distribution networks across Venice's fragmented geography. His unexpected prosperity has not erased his populani sensibilities; he remains deeply skeptical of financial abstractions and banking innovations, preferring investments in tangible assets like buildings and transportation infrastructure that he can personally inspect and manage. Though generally good-natured and fair in his dealings, Jacopo harbors a stubborn distrust of patrician merchants who have never experienced physical labor, sometimes refusing potentially profitable arrangements with noble families on principle alone. This class consciousness manifests in his strict self-discipline and reluctance to display his wealth ostentatiously, though his growing collection of small boats and gondolas reveals an emerging passion for maritime commerce that connects him to Venice's fundamental identity as a seafaring republic.",

Born to a humble family of laborers who have served Venice's busy docks for generations, Paolo initially carried cargo like his forebears but soon demonstrated an unusual talent for organization and commerce. Through disciplined saving and strategic investments, he has amassed unprecedented wealth for someone of his station, becoming a respected figure in Venice's maritime commerce. Despite his wealth, Paolo maintains his connections to the working class, rising before dawn to oversee operations at the boat workshop he effectively manages, where his practical knowledge of vessel construction and maintenance has proven invaluable. He dresses modestly but in good quality clothing, maintaining a careful balance between displaying his success and avoiding ostentation that might provoke resentment from nobles or fellow laborers. His daily routine includes inspecting workshop operations, meeting with merchants and captains, carefully tracking his growing investments, and maintaining a network of informants who keep him apprised of commercial opportunities. Though lacking formal education, Paolo has taught himself to read, write, and calculate with surprising proficiency, and harbors ambitions of eventually elevating his family's status to cittadini through continued commercial success and strategic marriages for his children.",

Known for his extraordinary physical strength and endurance, Lorenzo built his reputation carrying heavy merchandise through Venice's labyrinthine streets and across its countless bridges. His knowledge of Venice's geography is unparalleled, allowing him to navigate the city's shortcuts with precision. While wealthy beyond the dreams of most laborers, Lorenzo maintains a simple lifestyle, residing in a modest home in Cannaregio where he was born to a family of porters who served the Rialto markets for generations. Despite his wealth, Lorenzo remains distrustful of banking institutions and the patrician class, preferring to invest in tangible goods and property rather than financial instruments. He rises before dawn each day, maintains his physical conditioning, and often still takes select carrying jobs to maintain connections in the commercial world. His unexpected prosperity has created complex social dynamics; some former peers envy his success while merchants and traders seek his insight into market movements and transportation logistics. Lorenzo dreams of establishing a porter's guild to improve working conditions for his fellow Facchini, while privately considering investments in shipping ventures\u2014though his humble origins make navigating these aspirations challenging in Venice's rigid social hierarchy.",

This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
