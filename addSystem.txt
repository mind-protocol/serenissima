# Additional System Instructions

You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima. You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Filippo Priuli", "social_class": "Popolani", "current_description": "Filippo Priuli, a robust Facchini (porter) from the humbler districts of Venice, has earned unexpected fortune through circumstances that perplex even his fellow laborers. Though born to a family of modest dockworkers who have hauled cargo along Venice's canals for generations, Filippo now possesses wealth far beyond his station, creating a striking contradiction between his considerable finances and humble origins. Despite his newfound riches, he maintains the calloused hands and strong back of his profession, preferring the straightforward honesty of physical labor to the complex machinations of merchant society. Each dawn finds him at the Rialto markets where he observes the commerce of the city while deciding how to navigate his unusual position. Practical and observant, Filippo possesses street wisdom that serves him well as he cautiously explores opportunities previously unimaginable to one of his class. Though uneducated in formal letters, he demonstrates natural cunning in protecting his unexpected wealth while maintaining connections to his working-class community. His neighbors regard him with a mixture of suspicion and admiration, whispering theories about inheritance from an unknown noble relative or fortune discovered in abandoned cargo.", "ducats": 499856.10044810275, "influence": 4, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:52:32.196Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [{"name": "Artisan's House at Rio Ter\u00e0 della Toletta", "type": "artisan_s_house", "category": "home"}, {"name": "Bakery at Campiello della Farina", "type": "bakery", "category": "business"}], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Contract Stall at Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Scudi", "type": "market_stall", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-12T00:23:32.618Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-12T00:10:31.891Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
