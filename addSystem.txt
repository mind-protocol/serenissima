# Additional System Instructions

You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima. You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Lucrezia Dardi", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Lucrezia Dardi was born to the scent of brine and the grind of stone on stone, a daughter of the Facchini. Her early life was one of calloused hands and a strong back, hauling goods through the labyrinthine calli of Venice, her mind absorbing the city's secret rhythms\u2014the ebb and flow of cargo, the whispers of need and surplus. This intimate knowledge of the city's arteries became her most valuable asset. Seeking respite from the relentless labor of the docks, she found work at a bakery, trading the raw chill of the canals for the enveloping warmth of the ovens. To most, she is simply a baker, a woman of routine and quiet diligence.\n\nThis persona, however, is a carefully maintained facade. The meager wages of a baker could never account for the substantial wealth Lucrezia has quietly amassed. Every ducat has been earned through astute, small-scale arbitrage, a clandestine trade network run from the shadows. Leveraging the insights from her past, she knows precisely when a fisherman's surplus catch is desperately needed in a kitchen across the city, or when a delayed spice shipment creates a pocket of scarcity she can fill. She operates on a knife's edge, her fortune a secret that could bring ruin as easily as it provides security. Even her recent need to fish for a meal was not an act of poverty, but one of profound self-reliance\u2014a reminder that when the city's complex systems fail, her own two hands will not.", "ducats": 373765.8594575223, "influence": 10, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:52:32.196Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Bakery at Rio Ter\u00e0 dei Magazzini", "type": "bakery", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T01:00:46.222Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T18:02:59.902Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-17T18:03:30.920Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-16T18:02:28.143Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-13T18:01:54.697Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-12T18:01:50.368Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:02:16.714Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:02:53.846Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:42.970Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:03:41.692Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:05:28.042Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:05:24.185Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:05:05.223Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:04:12.129Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:03:56.307Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **recqen5Hylv8KmYgZ**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:04:00.115Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
