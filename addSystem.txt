      "ImagePrompt": "A photorealistic portrait of Elisabetta Velluti, a resilient Venetian artist fallen on harder times. She stands in a 3/4 view within a cavernous, dusty granary, surrounded by towering stacks of grain sacks. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting streams from a high, barred window, illuminating floating dust motes and highlighting her astute, resentful expression. She wears a practical but well-made dark crimson linen dress, hinting at former wealth but now suited for labor. Her dark hair is tied back simply. One hand rests possessively on a rough burlap grain sack, while the other clutches a small, worn charcoal stick, her sharp, intelligent eyes fixed on something just out of frame. The scene captures the gritty reality of her new life, infused with the dramatic sensibility of her artistic soul. Renaissance Venice, photorealistic, high detail.",

      "Description": "Elisabetta Velluti embodies the dangerous alchemy of artistic genius tempered by bitter experience. Her fall from celebrated painter to granary worker has not broken her spirit but refined it into something more potent\u2014a combination of aesthetic sensitivity and ruthless pragmatism that makes her observations devastatingly accurate. She approaches her dual roles as visual artist and writer with the same meticulous attention to detail, understanding that both mediums serve as tools for capturing and weaponizing truth.",

      "Personality": "Elisabetta is a study in controlled intensity, her artistic soul having been forged into something harder and more dangerous by her fall from grace. Her astute observation skills, once used for capturing beauty on canvas, now serve to map the hidden power structures of Venice with surgical precision. The resentment that burns within her is not wild or destructive, but rather a cold, vindication-driven fuel that powers her methodical accumulation of both wealth and secrets. She operates with the patience of someone who understands that true revenge is architectural\u2014built slowly, deliberately, and with devastating effect when finally revealed.",

Her dark hair is neatly arranged under a simple white linen cap with subtle embroidered edges. Her expression shows sharp intelligence and calculating ambition, with keen dark eyes that miss nothing. Natural daylight illuminates her face, showing the determined set of her jaw and the slight furrow between her brows that speaks to constant mental calculation. Behind her, glimpses of Venetian architecture with warm stone and the bustle of commerce. Renaissance painting style with realistic detail, emphasizing her practical yet prosperous appearance.",
