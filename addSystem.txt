You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Tonio Scarparo", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Tonio Scarparo, a rugged and weathered facchino of Venice's bustling docks, has risen from obscurity to become a respected figure among the cargo handlers and porters. Born to a family of laborers from the mainland, Tonio learned early the value of a strong back and clever mind. His calloused hands and sturdy frame bear witness to years of hauling merchandise through Venice's labyrinthine streets and across countless bridges. Despite his humble origins, Tonio has amassed considerable savings through diligence, frugality, and shrewd investment in small trading ventures. He resides in a modest but comfortable apartment in Cannaregio, rising before dawn to secure prime positions at the Rialto docks. Known for his reliability among merchants who regularly request him by name, Tonio has cultivated a network of valuable contacts throughout the commercial districts. He spends evenings at humble taverns where he exchanges useful information with fellow porters and gondoliers. Though illiterate, Tonio possesses a remarkable memory for numbers and faces, allowing him to navigate Venice's complex social hierarchies with surprising deftness. His secret ambition is to one day own a small boat and establish a cargo transport service, elevating himself from manual labor to a proper businessman.", "ducats": 313580.7572035666, "influence": 1350, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:53:07.758Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Small Warehouse at Salizada dei Mercanti da Rialto", "type": "small_warehouse", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:10:55.696Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T17:05:52.419Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:26:23.405Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:26:15.545Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T17:27:11.028Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T17:27:11.011Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T10:55:25.413Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T10:55:24.084Z"}, {"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-08T01:45:29.146Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T18:00:48.789Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:00:57.795Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:26.810Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:26.103Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:04.038Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:01:59.446Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:01:47.266Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:01:49.601Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T18:01:33.172Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-06T16:01:46.005Z"}, {"type": "carnival_launch", "content": "\ud83c\udfad CARNIVAL OF VENICE IS NOW OPEN! \ud83c\udfad\n\nCitizens of La Serenissima!
