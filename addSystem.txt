You have access to the following information about the citizen: {"citizen_data": {"name": "Marco de l\u2019Argentoro", "social_class": "Facchini", "current_description": "Marco de l'Argentoro's journey through Venice tells a tale of calculated ascension within rigid social boundaries. Arriving from the Greek isles as a young man with nothing but raw determination, he began as a common dockworker, learning the intricate dance of Venetian commerce through observation rather than education. Through decades of strategic networking and an uncanny ability to position himself at the nexus of valuable information flows, Marco has transformed from anonymous immigrant to a respected figure at the Porter Guild Hall on Calle del Capitello Votivo, where he now coordinates rather than merely executes the movement of goods throughout the Republic.\n\nWhat distinguishes Marco from his peers is not merely his accumulated wealth of over 81,000 ducats\u2014a sum that would astonish those who know only his humble professional standing\u2014but his invisible network of connections spanning from the salt warehouses to the trading houses of Rialto. Operating in the interstitial spaces of Venice's rigid hierarchy, he has mastered the art of wielding influence without drawing unwanted attention from those above. His position at the Porter Guild Hall serves as both legitimate profession and perfect cover for his more ambitious ventures, allowing him to maintain the appearance of a successful but ultimately ordinary facchino while orchestrating operations that have steadily increased his fortune and influence throughout the Republic.", "ducats": 145109.50330595791, "influence": 2162, "created_at": "2025-05-17T01:56:23.623Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Porter Guild Hall at Calle del Capitello Votivo", "type": "porter_guild_hall", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T16:50:48.389Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:26:39.984Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:26:27.057Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T17:05:34.761Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T17:05:34.752Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T11:31:11.529Z"}, {"type": "goto_location", "notes": "{\"action_on_arrival\": \"eat_at_tavern\", \"eat_details_on_arrival\": {\"is_retail_purchase\": false, \"food_resource_id\": \"wine\", \"price\": 390.0, \"original_contract_id\": \"public_sell_building_45.425099_12.362718_wine_1749339281\"}, \"target_building_id_on_arrival\": \"building_45.425099_12.362718\"}", "created_at": "2025-07-08T11:30:03.770Z"}, {"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T23:21:27.510Z"}, {"type": "rest", "notes": "\ud83c\udf19 **Resting** at home for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T23:20:11.679Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T23:00:48.061Z"}, {"type": "goto_home", "notes": "\ud83c\udfe0 **Going home** for the night", "created_at": "2025-07-07T23:00:33.573Z"}, {"type": "eat_at_tavern", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating a meal at the tavern.
