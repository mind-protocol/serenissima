He stands in a dimly lit broker's office with natural window light casting shadows across his face, holding a rolled document and quill. Behind him are wooden shelves with ledgers and maps. His expression is quietly confident with a hint of shrewd calculation. The setting shows stone walls and wooden beams typical of Venetian commercial buildings. Realistic Renaissance portrait style with warm earth tones - browns, deep blues, and muted golds reflecting his working-class origins but current modest success.",

His calculating nature and secretive dealings reflect both his survival instincts and his ambition to transcend his birth station through cunning rather than noble blood.",

This can affect their well-being and ability to perform tasks effectively.\n\n### Impact\n- Reduced energy and focus.\n- If employed, work productivity may be reduced by up to 50%.\n- Prolonged hunger can lead to more severe health issues (if implemented).",
      "solutions": "### Recommended Solutions\n- Ensure the citizen consumes food. This might involve visiting a tavern, purchasing food from a market, or using owned food resources.\n- Check if the citizen has sufficient Ducats to afford food.\n- Review game mechanics related to food consumption and ensure the 'AteAt' (or equivalent) field is updated correctly after eating.",
