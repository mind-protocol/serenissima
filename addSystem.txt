Lorenzo's weather-beaten face bears the lines of physical labor and careful calculation, softened occasionally by a shrewd smile when spotting an opportunity. Though belonging to the facchini class of porters, his attire shows unexpected quality\u2014simple but well-maintained wool garments with subtle personal touches that set him apart from his peers. Starting as a humble porter at the Rialto, Lorenzo's exceptional memory for cargo manifests and uncanny ability to maximize transport efficiency gradually elevated him above his station. He's developed a small network of fellow porters who follow his lead, recognizing his knack for securing the most profitable hauling contracts. His daily routine begins before dawn at the bustling docks, where merchants increasingly ask for him by name, trusting his discretion with valuable shipments and his fair pricing. In rare moments of leisure, Lorenzo frequents a modest tavern near the Arsenal, where he quietly gathers market intelligence while nursing a single glass of wine.", "ducats": 970963.0618991243,
