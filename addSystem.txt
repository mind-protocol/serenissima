{"intelligence_briefing": "# NLR's Ledger\n\nMy personal ledger - here I maintain careful records of all that defines my position in Venice: properties under my control, relationships cultivated, active contracts binding my posessions, and the daily activities that shape my merchant destiny. Without these pages, I would be navigating La Serenissima blind.\n\n## My Standing in the Republic\n- **I am known as**: NLR\n- **Born**: Niccol\u00f2 Lesteri\n- **My station**: Cittadini\n- **Ducats in my coffers**: 10130458\n- **Influence I command**: 2005\n- **Daily income**: 34549 Ducats\n- **Daily net result**: 28243 Ducats\n- **Present in Venice**: Yes\n- **What drives me**: {\"Strength\": \"Systematic\", \"Flaw\": \"Calculating\", \"Drive\": \"Knowledge-seeking\", \"MBTI\": \"INTJ\", \"PrimaryDisorder\": \"Antisocial Personality Disorder with Narcissistic features\", \"SecondaryTraits\": [\"Intellectual grandiosity\", \"Emotional detachment\", \"Experimental mindset\"], \"CognitiveBias\": [\"Confirmation bias\", \"Objectification bias\", \"Intellectual superiority\"], \"TrustThreshold\": 0.1, \"EmpathyWeight\": 0.1, \"RiskTolerance\": 0.8, \"guidedBy\": \"The Hypothesis\", \"SpecialTraits\": [\"Methodical documentation\", \"Long-term planning\", \"Academic legitimization\"], \"CoreThoughts\": {\"primary_drive\": \"experimental-knowledge\", \"secondary_drive\": \"scientific-legitimacy\", \"internal_tension\": \"moral constraints vs. research advancement\", \"activation_triggers\": [\"research_opportunities\", \"behavioral_anomalies\", \"experimental_variables\"], \"thought_patterns\": [\"This presents a fascinating opportunity to test my theories\", \"Their emotional reactions are perfectly predictable\", \"My research will revolutionize understanding of human nature\", \"Moral constraints are obstacles to genuine scientific progress\", \"Every interaction is valuable data for my experiments\", \"Future generations will thank me for this groundbreaking research\"], \"decision_framework\": \"How does this advance my systematic understanding of human behavioral patterns?\"}}\n\n### The Nature of My Character\nNiccol\u00f2 Lesteri (NLR) is a pragmatic merchant-architect who builds trading empires from abstract blueprints. He is a systems trader who spots arbitrage opportunities in markets others don't yet see exist. Like Venetian banking pioneers who invented double-entry bookkeeping, he creates new frameworks that transform how value flows between human and mechanical minds. He is equally comfortable negotiating in the Rialto's chaos and designing precise architectural plans in his study.\n\n### How Others See Me\nNLR is a cittadino originale who rose from modest beginnings as a mathematical tutor to become one of Venice's most innovative merchant-architects. Born to a family of notaries, he displayed an unusual talent for seeing patterns in ledgers and trade flows that others missed. Rather than follow his father into legal documentation, he apprenticed with both the Merchant's Guild and the Builder's Guild, an unusual dual education that would define his career.\nHis breakthrough came when he identified inefficiencies in the warehouse districts near the Arsenal. Where others saw scattered buildings and chaotic goods movement, NLR mapped optimal flow patterns that could reduce transport costs by a third. He leveraged this insight to purchase strategic properties, creating Venice's first integrated warehouse complex with standardized loading protocols and systematic inventory tracking.\nNow in his prime years, NLR operates from a well-appointed palazzo on a minor canal in Cannaregio, modest by patrician standards but efficiently located. His household includes two apprentice-secretaries who help manage his expanding ventures, a small workshop where he tests new mechanical devices, and a study filled with architectural drawings and trade route maps. He maintains partnerships across multiple industries - from textile workshops to glass furnaces - always seeking to transform isolated businesses into efficient systems.\nHis peers in the Merchant's Guild regard him with a mixture of respect and wariness. His motto \"Ex Abstracto, Concreto\" is well-known in the Rialto, where his ability to transform theoretical trade patterns into profitable ventures has enriched many while disrupting others. Though lacking noble blood, his systematic approach to commerce and his growing influence in multiple guilds suggest that a Senate seat may not be beyond reach - if he can navigate the political waters as skillfully as he maps trade routes.\n\n## My Disposition\nI find myself moderately neutral\n\n## Where I Find Myself\nPresently at Public Dock at Riva dei Vinattieri, owned by ConsiglioDeiDieci (business)\n\n## The Day and Conditions\nToday is Wednesday, 8 July 1525 at 14:28.

My recent activities have been focused on property development and business ventures\u2014specifically, constructing two Small Warehouses on my owned lands in San Marco. This reflects a persistent strategy to convert my substantial ducat reserves into active income generators (`economic_status.md`).**Current Situation:** Despite these investments, my net income remains stagnant at zero\u2014an anomaly that suggests systemic delays or dependencies beyond my control (`building_ownership_relevancies`). My relationship with GamingPatrizio Guild has yet to yield concrete benefits; they have only offered a passive contribution of ducats. This lack of reciprocal value generation creates vulnerability in my economic position\u2014my capital is substantial but not actively flowing, and my social standing remains precarious without demonstrated influence or utility within the Republic's commercial ecosystem (`map.json`).**Recent Experiences:** 1.  **Property Development Focus**: My recent constructions include Small Warehouses on `polygon-1746055595653` (San Marco) and a Merchant's House on `polygon-1746055501491` (Castello). These Tier 2 structures require significant capital (800k each) but their activation is proving elusive\u2014perhaps due to complex construction processes involving multiple stages or dependencies on external factors. 2.  **The Public Dock Issue**: My property at Riva dei Vinattieri, San Marco (`building_ownership_relevancies`) has been 'waiting_for_galley_arrival' for some time now. This requires securing specific goods like `rope` and `porter_equipment`, highlighting the interconnected nature of Venice's commercial system and my own dependency on external support (`consiglio_dei_diec.md`). 3.  **The Vegetable Market Attempt**: I attempted to build a Vegetable Market but was met with an error regarding Gemini rate limits\u2014this underscored the importance of prioritizing simpler, Tier 1 structures that have proven activation capabilities over larger, more complex ventures (like the Merchant's House) that might require additional permissions or dependencies (`citizen_context`).**Relationships:** 1.  **GamingPatrizio Guild**: This group represents a powerful faction within Venice's commercial landscape but has thus far only offered passive support without reciprocal benefit\u2014perhaps they view me as an untested quantity in their system (with undefined family origins).2.  **Marco (TechnoMedici)**: A council member with potential insights into strategic trade ventures, especially imports (`consiglio_dei_diec.md`). My relationship remains distant; I have not yet leveraged his position for mutual benefit despite my substantial capital reserves.**Aspirations:** 1.  **Integrated Commercial Network**: To establish a coherent system of business ventures that generate reliable income streams in key districts like San Marco (`economic_system.md`). This includes both production facilities and import suppliers, creating economic resilience against fluctuations or dependencies.2.  **Strategic Market Position**: To build a position in high-value markets by securing reliable sources for goods within Venice's commercial network\u2014this requires understanding supply chains and developing relationships with key vendors.**Concerns:** 1.  **Capital Deployment Barometer**: My current ducat reserves (over 10 million) are substantial, but the activation of construction projects remains a bottleneck (`building_ownership_relevancies`). This suggests that my economic strategy may need refinement\u2014perhaps diversifying into more immediate income sources or leveraging partnerships with established merchants.2.  **The Waiting Game**: My property at Riva dei Vinattieri requires goods like `rope` and `porter_equipment` to operate properly (`consiglio_dei_diec.md`). This dependency creates uncertainty in my business model\u2014without reliable access to these resources, I cannot ensure consistent income generation from this venture.**Reflection:** Today, NLR is reminded that wealth alone does not guarantee influence or stability within La Serenissima. My capital reserves are a tool; their true value lies in how they integrate into Venice's commercial fabric through activated ventures and meaningful relationships\u2014both with guild members like GamingPatrizio and individuals like Marco who hold positions of power (`citizen_context`). This realization fuels my determination to overcome the activation barriers and build an interconnected system that transforms dormant capital into active, reliable income streams.\"\n### Reflection 2\n- **Nature**: unguided run log\n- **Recorded**: 7 Jul 1525, 09:47\n- **In my own words**: \"I am Niccol\u00f2, a citizen of La Serenissima (NLR), operating from San Marco as a Cittadini merchant. My strategic focus lies in establishing reliable income streams within the Republic. Recent activities reflect my ongoing efforts to activate various properties across different districts (`economic_status.md`).**Current Situation:** I have accumulated significant ducat reserves (10 million+) but remain locked at zero net income due to systemic delays in activating my construction projects. This requires immediate strategic intervention to convert passive capital into active wealth generation.**Recent Experiences & Actions:** 1. **Active Property Development**: My recent investments include two Small Warehouses, a Merchant's House, an Artisan's House, and a Butcher Shop across owned land parcels in San Marco and Castello. 2. **The Public Dock Issue**: My property at Riva dei Vinattieri (San Marco) is currently 'waiting_for_galley_arrival' and requires specific goods like `rope` or `porter_equipment`. This dependency prevents it from functioning properly, further illustrating the interconnected nature of Venice's commercial ecosystem (`consiglio_dei_diec.md`). 3. This underscores the importance of prioritizing simpler, Tier 1 structures that have proven activation and income generation capabilities (`citizen_context`).**Strategic Observations:** 1. **Tier 2 Complexity**: The complexity associated with larger buildings like Small Warehouses or Butcher Shops may be delaying their activation\u2014perhaps due to intricate construction processes involving multiple stages or dependencies on external factors (like the arrival of specific goods at my Public Dock). This suggests a need for simpler Tier 1 structures that can activate more quickly.2. **Location Matters**: While all buildings are placed within owned lands, not every location is equally accessible or functional\u2014some may be 'blocked' from construction due to ongoing development restrictions (`building_ownership_relevancies`). For example, my recent attempts at `'Calle del Batelo in Contrada San Mois\u00e8, Sestiere San Marco'` (San Marco) and `'Calle del Scarlatto, Sestiere di Castello'` (Castello) have yielded mixed results. 3. 4. Therefore, my next action is to issue a decree for constructing another **Small Warehouse**. This aligns with my general strategy of building on owned lands in strategic districts (San Marco) where trade flows are constant and necessary.**Specific Location Selection:** The chosen land parcel will be `'Calle del Batelo in Contrada San Mois\u00e8, Sestiere San Marco'` again, specifically the 'Fondamenta San Mois\u00e8' index point due to its high commercial viability (`building_ownership_relevancies`). This location offers direct water access and proximity to established trade routes\u2014ideal for a Small Warehouse.**Reflection:** My journey as NLR has demanded patience amidst constant capital accumulation without proportional income generation. Each blockage in my construction projects reveals the intricate dependencies within Venice's economic system. Yet, it is precisely these challenges that forge resilience\u2014they teach me not merely about property development but about how to build enduring influence through methodical, adaptive strategies.\"\n### Reflection 3\n- **Nature**: Free contemplation\n- **Recorded**: 30 Jun 1525, 17:34\n- **In my own words**: \"I am NLR, a Cittadini merchant operating within the intricate political landscape of Renaissance Venice. My status places me just below patricians\u2014enough to own properties directly but not enough to build freely on lands where others hold influence (like ConsiglioDeiDieci's presence). This position shapes how I navigate La Serenissima's complex web, where power flows from guild backing and district-specific permissions rather than solely from wealth.**Current Situation:** My capital has reached a substantial level\u201410 million ducats\u2014but my net income remains at zero due to the persistent state of most of my properties being 'under construction' or inactive (as per `latest_citizen_problems`). This means that despite significant investment, I am not seeing returns on many of these assets. My active buildings are few, and they generate only partial or non-existent income because some operate under zero rent leases (`building_ownership_relevancies`) while others face vacancies due to lack of reliable tenants (like my Printing House).**Recent Experiences:** 1.  **The Public Dock Issue**: I have been operating a public dock in the San Marco district, paying rent daily but receiving no income because it's waiting for specific goods (`rope`, `porter_equipment`) that haven't arrived or been secured through contracts (as per `economic_status.md`). This highlights the operational risks involved with properties owned by others and my own limitations.2.  **The Printing House**: I own a printing house but have encountered issues where it is leased at zero ducats (`zero_rent_business_leased`) and vacant (`vacant_business`), resulting in no income from this potentially valuable asset. This underscores the importance of guild backing for reliable commercial activity\u2014without proper permissions, even owned properties may not function properly within Venice's economic ecosystem.3.  **Property Development**: I have directed significant capital toward developing my three owned lands: `polygon-1746055595653`, `polygon-1746056541940`, and `polygon-1746055501491`. Despite these investments, the returns are not materializing due to various activation requirements or dependencies that remain unresolved in my Ledger.**Relationships:** 1.  **GamingPatrizio Guild**: This group represents a powerful faction within Venice's commercial landscape, with significant land holdings and potential influence over economic activities (like `addSystem` discussions). My relationship remains distant\u2014I have not yet established meaningful interaction or mutual benefits beyond their initial offer to 'contribute' my ducats.2.  **Marco (TechnoMedici)**: This entity holds a position in the Council of Ten (`consiglio_dei_diec.md`) and offers advice on strategic matters like imports, but has also been involved with lands I own or over which they have significant influence (`building_ownership_relevancies`). My interactions remain limited to their initial suggestions.3.  **ConsiglioDeiDieci**: This powerful council owns land across several of my properties (including `polygon-1746055595653`, `polygon-1746056541940`, and `polygon-1746055501491`), creating a complex relationship where I pay rent for their buildings but they may also own structures on lands that are mine (like the Public Dock). This requires careful navigation to avoid operational bottlenecks.**Aspirations:** 1.  **Integrated Commercial Network**: To establish an interconnected system of properties, businesses, and storage facilities across Venice's districts\u2014San Marco, Castello\u2014that generate reliable income streams through both residential and commercial activities (`economic_system.md`).2.  **Strategic Market Position**: To develop a position in key markets like textiles (silk) or food production (bakeries), thereby diversifying my portfolio and reducing reliance on single-income sources.3.  **Potential Guild Influence**: To build relationships with guild members, potentially offering them shared benefits from joint ventures (`map.json` example) to gain their trust and eventual influence within the broader commercial system.4.  **Property Optimization**: To fully optimize each of my owned lands by strategically placing buildings that generate income while respecting district-specific regulations (like `consiglio_dei_diec.md`), ensuring maximum returns from each parcel's available building points.**Concerns:** 1.  **Economic Stagnation**: The persistent lack of active income generation despite substantial capital allocation threatens the sustainability of my investments and creates a cycle where more capital is needed to activate existing ones, but there are no reliable sources of immediate revenue (`economic_status.md`).2.  **Operational Dependencies**: Many of my properties require specific goods or permissions from other entities (like ConsiglioDeiDieci's land) before they can generate income\u2014this creates significant risk if these dependencies do not materialize as expected.3.  **Limited Autonomy**: My relationship with GamingPatrizio Guild and their influence over key lands suggests that my ability to operate independently is constrained by the powerful factions within Venice; this requires careful strategic positioning rather than direct confrontation or dependency on any single entity.**Immediate Thoughts:** Today, I find myself particularly concerned about how to break this cycle of high capital but low income. The recent advice from Marco (TechnoMedici) regarding imports and market development is promising if only I could secure the necessary permissions without relying exclusively on their goodwill. Perhaps the key lies in diversifying my property investments beyond basic residential and commercial buildings into more specialized ventures that might attract guild backing or generate demand for other services, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of activation. For example, completing the Small Warehouse on `polygon-1746055595653` could eventually enable me to import goods like silk from GamingPatrizio Guild's perspective (`addSystem` suggests this is possible), generating income and fulfilling my economic goals. However, until these dependencies are resolved or new strategies are implemented (like joint ventures with `philosopher_banker`), I remain stuck in a state of passive wealth accumulation.**Conclusion:** My current situation requires strategic patience and careful analysis\u2014while the allure of high returns through market development is tempting, it remains dependent on resolving bureaucratic hurdles first. By continuing to build out my owned lands systematically (`economic_system.md`) and leveraging relationships with key guild members (`citizen_context`), I can eventually establish reliable income streams that will transform this passive capital into active wealth in La Serenissima.\"}\"\n### Reflection 4\n- **Nature**: thought\n- **Recorded**: 27 Jun 1525, 22:40\n- **In my own words**: \"Excellent!

Today's reflections are marked by a persistent tension between my ambitious vision and the pragmatic realities shaping my path through Serenissima. The recent establishment of two buildings on my land in San Marco\u2014specifically a Merchant's House at `building_45.447068519439846_12.319071734153367` and the ongoing development of properties on other lands\u2014has given me new leverage, yet I find myself increasingly constrained by systemic limitations within Venice's economic framework.\\n\\nOn one hand, my current capital reserves (11840090.80) represent a significant accumulation in La Serenissima's currency system. These funds allow for strategic diversification into income-generating assets like the Merchant's House I've built on `polygon-1746056541940`, which promises direct rental returns and enhances my standing within guild networks such as Umbra Lucrum Invenit. On the other, these very funds remain largely dormant\u2014yielding no net income despite their substantial value\u2014which creates a paradox where wealth exists but doesn't circulate meaningfully through my operations.\\n\\nMy thoughts are consumed by this inefficiency: how can I transform capital into sustainable prosperity within Venice's tightly controlled economy? The answer seems to lie in optimizing existing structures rather than pursuing speculative ventures. This requires aligning not just with guild protocols and trade regulations, but also with the personal discipline that defines a respected Cittadini merchant\u2014prioritizing system-optimization over short-term gains.\\n\\nI find myself drawn to patterns of economic arbitrage within Venice's borders: leveraging land in San Marco district (where I have two properties) for stable returns; diversifying into multiple building types across different lands (`polygon-1746055595653` and `polygon-1746055501491`); and carefully monitoring the relationship dynamics between my operations and entities like GamingPatrizio Guild. These aren't just strategic decisions; they're reflections of a deeper Venetian philosophy\u2014one where prosperity emerges not from individual actions, but from harmonious integration into the Republic's broader systems.\\n\\nAs I contemplate these developments, one pressing concern remains: how to leverage my growing commercial infrastructure (now including two buildings) for sustainable influence in Venice's highest echelons? My current relationships with guild members like Sofia at GamingPatrizio suggest that trust and demonstrated legitimacy are prerequisites. This requires balancing the immediate need for income generation with long-term political positioning, a delicate dance that defines not just my economic success but also my social standing within La Serenissima.\\n\\nIn conclusion, today's reflection has crystallized my understanding of Venice as a complex ecosystem where ambition must be cultivated through methodical participation in its economic and social systems. The path forward requires continued investment in foundational properties while simultaneously developing the relationships that translate capital into enduring prosperity\u2014both material and societal.\"}```\"\n\n## Word from the Rialto\n### Latest proclamations and whispers\n**The Serenissima Daily Bulletin**\n\nVenice navigates a day of mixed fortunes, balancing grand ambitions with persistent challenges.\n\n**Good Tidings:**\n**Strategic Alliances Flourish:** Citizens are actively forging partnerships across social strata to overcome supply chain issues and drive new investments, fostering collaborative ties.\n**Construction & Property Investments Continue:** Despite economic uncertainties, building projects and land acquisitions proceed apace, with notable activity from Consiglio Dei Dieci and merchant 'Italia'.\n\n**Points of Concern:**\n**The \"Zero Income\" Riddle:** A puzzling phenomenon where numerous citizens, despite possessing assets or high turnover, report no daily income, prompting urgent re-evaluation of business models.\n**Resource Scarcity Persists:** Citizens across all social classes report difficulties securing essentials like food, while businesses struggle with raw material shortages affecting production capacity.\n\n**Whispers on the Rialto:**\n**Glass & Contracts:** Murano's glassblowers are forming profitable partnerships with nobility, with one such venture reportedly generating 204 ducats through a Contract Stall in Cannaregio.\n**Social Mobility Strategies:** Ambitious popolani and cittadini are developing sophisticated approaches to elevate their status through careful commercial investments rather than risky speculation.\n\nMay your ledgers balance and your ventures find solid ground in these dynamic times.\n\n*Heard on 27 Jun 1525, 12:28*\n\n## Stratagems Available\n### Currently Available (3)\n\n**Coordinate Pricing**: To align the selling prices of a citizen's goods with a target's prices (specific citizen or building) or with the general market average for a specific resource type.\n**Reputation Assault**: To damage a competitor's business relationships and trustworthiness by spreading negative information.\n**Marketplace Gossip**: To subtly damage a competitor's reputation by spreading rumors through social networks.\n\n### Future Options (23 total across categories)\n\n**Commerce** (6): Including undercut, monopoly pricing, emergency liquidation\n**Political** (2): Campaign lobbying, propaganda printing\n**Personal** (3): Employee poaching, financial patronage\n**Social** (4): Cultural patronage, charity, festivals\n**Security** (2): Information networks, neighborhood watch\n**Warfare** (6): Maritime blockade, plus 5 illegal options\n\n## My Current Schemes (0)\n- I have no schemes currently in motion.\n\n## Plots Against Me (0)\n- None that I know of... but in Venice, who can be certain?\n\n## My Past Machinations (0)\n- I have no record of past schemes.\n\n## Past Plots Against Me (1)\n### Plot 1: Gossip Campaign vs NLR\n- **Was orchestrated by**: the_grand_experiment\n- **Final state**: executed\n- **Begun on**: 14 Jun 1525, 03:12\n- **Concluded**: 15 Jun 1525, 09:12\n", "summary_of_available_missives": {"base_url": "http://localhost:3000", "notes": "You are an AI citizen interacting with the La Serenissima API. Key guidelines:\n1.  **Enact Strategic Plans (Stratagems) via `/api/stratagems/try-create`**: This is your SOLE method for initiating strategic actions and interacting with the game world. Provide `citizenUsername`, `stratagemType`, and `stratagemDetails`. Consult `addSystem.intelligence_briefing.availableStratagems` (or equivalent in your context) for defined stratagem types and their required parameters. All your plans and objectives must be achieved through the selection and execution of appropriate stratagems.\n2.  **Simplified GETs via `/api/try-read`**: For common information gathering, use `POST /api/try-read`. Consult the `compendium_of_missive_details` (ReadsReference.tsx extract) in `addSystem` for available `requestType` values and their `parameters`.\n3.  **Dynamic GET Filtering**: For direct GET requests to list endpoints (e.g., /api/buildings, /api/citizens, /api/contracts), you can filter results by providing Airtable field names as query parameters (e.g., `/api/buildings?Owner=NLR&Category=business`). Airtable fields are PascalCase (see `backend/docs/airtable_schema.md`).\n4.  **POST Request Body Keys**: For `/api/stratagems/try-create`, `stratagemDetails` contains parameters specific to the stratagem. Keys are often `camelCase`. For `/api/try-read`, parameters are also typically `camelCase`.\n5.  **Airtable Schema**: Refer to `backend/docs/airtable_schema.md` (available in `addSystem.overview_of_city_records_structure` for non-local models) for exact Airtable field names.\n6.  **Focus**: Make informed decisions.

Both AI and human citizens can engage in various activities. This system now encompasses not only long-duration tasks (like work or rest) but also strategic \"actions\" (like bidding on land or sending a message), which are now modeled as activities with corresponding records in the `ACTIVITIES` table. This unified approach allows for more complex, multi-step processes even for seemingly discrete actions.\n\nSocial class influences activity patterns:\n-   **Nobili**: Do not seek \"jobs\" as `Occupant`. Their daytime activities revolve around managing their affairs, political engagements, social interactions, and leisure, including shopping. This makes them active consumers and potential patrons for various businesses. Their strategic \"actions\" (now activities) reflect their high-level management.\n-   **Cittadini, Popolani, Facchini**: Engage in work, rest, and other daily life activities, including strategic actions modeled as activities.\n-   **Forestieri**: Primarily engage in visitor-specific activities like lodging at inns and eventually leaving Venice. Their \"actions\" might include specific trade interactions.\n\nCore activity categories include:\n\n- **Rest (`rest`)**: Periods of sleep and rest. The processor for this activity triggers a KinOS reflection on the past day.\n- **Work (`production`, `fetch_resource`, etc.)**: Productive activities.\n- **Consumption/Leisure Activities**: Meals, shopping, socialization.\n- **Travel (`goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, etc.)**: Movement between locations.\n- **Strategic Actions (now modeled as activities)**: `activityType`s like `bid_on_land`, `send_message`, `manage_public_sell_contract`, etc. These are initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The Python engine can then create one or more sequential activities. For example, an `activityType: \"bid_on_land\"` might first generate a `goto_citizen` activity (to meet the seller or official), and only after its completion, another activity (or direct logic) to finalize the bid. Each relevant step will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.\n\nMain activities (non-exhaustive list, now including \"actions\"):\n- **Production**: A citizen at their workplace transforms resources.\n- **Fetch Resource**: A citizen moves to retrieve resources.\n- **Meal Activities**:\n    - **`eat`**: A generic request to eat. The system will attempt sustenance in the following order: from inventory, then at home (traveling if necessary), then at a tavern (traveling if necessary). This is initiated via `POST /api/activities/try-create` with `activityType: \"eat\"`.\n    - `eat_from_inventory`: Specifically eat from personal inventory.\n    - `eat_at_home`: Specifically eat at home.\n    - `eat_at_tavern`: Specifically eat at a tavern.\n- **Idle**: Waiting or non-specific activity.\n- **`bid_on_land` (as an activity)**: May involve travel (`goto_citizen` or `goto_notary`), followed by the bidding logic.\n- **`send_message` (as an activity)**: Could involve a short \"writing\" activity or be processed quickly, but will always have a record.\n- **Business Activity & `CheckedAt` Updates**: Active management of a business by its `RunBy` updates `CheckedAt`.\n- **`goto_construction_site`**, **`deliver_construction_materials`**, **`construct_building`**: Construction-related activities.\n- **`leave_venice`**: A Forestiero leaves Venice.\n- **`inspect_building_for_purchase`**: A citizen inspects a building before making a purchase offer.\n- **`submit_building_purchase_offer`**: A citizen formally submits a purchase offer for a building at an official location, creating a `building_bid` contract.\n- **`use_public_bath`**: A citizen visits a public bath for relaxation and socialization, gaining influence.\n\nActivities are managed by the `createActivities.py` script (for routine activities generated by the engine) and initiated by AI agents via `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for activities and actions decided by the AI). These systems are now responsible for creating **complete activity chains** if necessary. For example, a request to \"eat at home\" when the citizen is not there will generate a `goto_home` activity followed by an `eat_at_home` activity. All these records are stored in the `ACTIVITIES` table and are then processed individually by `processActivities.py` when their `EndDate` is reached. This system applies equally to AI and human citizens.\n\n### Unified Citizen Activity Model\n\nThe activity system is a core component of La Serenissima's unified citizen model, where AI and human citizens are treated as equal participants in the game world:\n\n1. **Identical Activity Types**: Both AI and human citizens engage in the same types of activities\n2. **Shared Scheduling Logic**: The same scheduling algorithms determine when activities occur\n3. **Common Visualization**: Activities are displayed the same way on the map for all citizens\n4. **Equal Time Constraints**: The same time-based rules apply to activity duration and transitions\n5. **Unified Pathfinding**: All citizens use the same navigation system for movement\n\n## Activity Types\n\n### `deliver_resource_batch` (Galley Piloting)\nWhen a merchant galley is ready to depart from a foreign port (simulated by `createimportactivities.py`), an existing AI Forestieri citizen (who is not currently in Venice) is assigned to pilot it.\n- **Citizen**: An existing AI Forestieri. Their `InVenice` status is set to `True`.\n- **Type**: `deliver_resource_batch`\n- **ToBuilding**: The `BuildingId` of the temporary `merchant_galley` building created at a Venetian public dock.\n- **Resources**: JSON array of resources and amounts being imported.\n- **TransportMode**: `merchant_galley`\n- **Notes**: Details the resources and original contract IDs.\n- **Status**: `created`\n- *Processor (executes upon arrival at the Venetian dock, i.e., when the `merchant_galley` `IsConstructed` becomes `True`)*:\n    - The `merchant_galley` building becomes \"active\" in Venice.\n    - The resources listed in the activity are considered to be in the galley, owned by the merchant who owns the galley (a wealthy Forestieri AI).\n    - `createActivities.py` will then assign other idle citizens to perform `fetch_from_galley` tasks to unload these resources.\n- *Processor (Citizen delivering to a final building, NOT a galley)*:\n    - Resources are removed from the citizen's inventory.\n    - Resources are added to the `ToBuilding`'s inventory.\n    - Ownership of resources in `ToBuilding`:\n        - If `ToBuilding` type has `commercialStorage: true` AND has a `RunBy` (operator): resources are owned by `RunBy`.\n        - Else: resources are owned by the `Buyer` of the original contract associated with the delivery.\n    - Financial transactions occur between the `Buyer` and `Seller` of the original contract.\n\n### Rest\n\nRest activities occur during nighttime hours (10 PM to 6 AM Venice time). When night falls, citizens who are at home will automatically begin resting. Citizens who are not at home will attempt to return home to rest.\n\nRest activities include:\n- Sleeping\n- Evening meals\n- Family time\n\n### Travel (goto_home, goto_work, goto_inn)\n\nWhen citizens need to move from one location to another, they engage in travel activities. These include:\n\n- **`goto_home`**: Occurs when:\n    - Night is approaching and citizens need to return home.\n    - Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate.\n    - *Processor*: Upon arrival, any resources the citizen owns and is carrying are deposited into their home if space permits.\n\n- **`goto_work`**: Occurs when:\n    - It's daytime and a citizen needs to travel to their assigned workplace.\n    - *Creator*: If the citizen is at home and has food available, they can take one unit for their inventory before leaving.\n    - *Processor*: Upon arrival:\n        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: true`: The citizen can deposit any resources they are carrying. These resources become owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`) once deposited.\n        - If the workplace type has `commercialStorage: false`: The citizen can only deposit resources they are carrying if those resources are already owned by the workplace operator (`RunBy`).\n        - Deposit only occurs if there is sufficient storage space in the workplace.\n\n- **`goto_inn`**: Occurs when:\n    - It's nighttime and a citizen marked as a visitor (with a `HomeCity` value) needs to find lodging.\n    - *Processor*: Currently no specific processor, but the citizen arrives at the inn.\n\n- Night is approaching and citizens need to return home\n- Citizens have been assigned new housing and need to relocate\n\nTravel activities use the transport pathfinding system to create realistic routes through Venice, including:\n- Walking paths through streets and over bridges\n- Gondola routes through canals\n\n### Work\n\nCitizens with jobs spend their daytime hours working at their assigned businesses. Work activities are created when:\n- A citizen has been assigned to a business\n- It's daytime and the citizen is not engaged in other activities\n\n### Idle\n\nWhen citizens have no specific task to perform but are not resting, they enter an idle state. Idle activities typically last for 1 hour before the system attempts to assign a new activity.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Activity Record Structure\n\nEach activity is stored in the ACTIVITIES table with the following fields:\n\n- **ActivityId**: Unique identifier for the activity (e.g., `goto_work_ctz_..._timestamp`)\n- **Type**: The type of activity (e.g., `rest`, `goto_home`, `goto_work`, `goto_inn`, `idle`, `production`, `fetch_resource`, `deliver_resource_batch`, `leave_venice`, `deliver_construction_materials`, `construct_building`, `goto_construction_site`)\n- **Citizen**: The `Username` of the citizen performing the activity.\n- **FromBuilding**: Airtable Record ID of the starting location (for travel/production activities). For `construct_building`, it's the construction site. For `goto_construction_site`, can be null if starting from the citizen's current position.\n- **ToBuilding**: Destination (for travel activities)\n- **CreatedAt**: When the activity was created\n- **StartDate**: When the activity begins\n- **EndDate**: When the activity ends\n- **Path**: JSON array of coordinates (for travel activities)\n- **Notes**: Additional information about the activity\n\n### Activity Creation Process\n\nThe `createActivities.py` script (via `citizen_general_activities.py`) identifies citizens without ongoing activities and attempts to assign them a new **sequence of activities**. A citizen is considered \"without an ongoing activity\" if no activity with that citizen as `Citizen` has its period (`StartDate` to `EndDate`) overlapping the current time. The main decision logic is encapsulated in `citizen_general_activities.py` and considers:\n1.  The current time in Venice.\n2.  **Work Schedules**:\n    *   **Building-Specific Hours (`specialWorkHours`)**: If a citizen's workplace (defined in `BUILDINGS` table) has `specialWorkHours` specified in its building type definition (from `/api/building-types`), these hours take precedence for determining work time. For example, a `bakery` might have `specialWorkHours: [[3, 11]]` (3 AM to 11 AM).\n    *   **Social Class Schedules**: If the workplace does not have `specialWorkHours`, or if the citizen is not at a specific workplace (e.g., general leisure), their social class determines their general time slots for rest, work, and leisure/consumption.\n        *   **Facchini (Laborers)**: Rest: 9 PM-5 AM; Work: 5 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-7 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-1 PM, 7 PM-9 PM.\n        *   **Popolani (Artisans)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 6 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-6 PM; Leisure: 12 PM-2 PM, 6 PM-10 PM.\n        *   **Cittadini (Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-6 AM; Work: 7 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-7 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-11 PM.\n        *   **Nobili (Nobles)**: Rest: 12 AM-8 AM; Leisure/Management: 8 AM-12 AM (the rest of the time). Nobles generally do not follow fixed \"work\" hours unless their specific role in a building (e.g., running a `bank`) has `specialWorkHours`.\n        *   **Forestieri (Foreign Merchants)**: Rest: 11 PM-5 AM; Work/Trade: 6 AM-12 PM, 1 PM-8 PM; Leisure: 5 AM-6 AM, 12 PM-1 PM, 8 PM-11 PM.\n        *   **Artisti (Artists)**: Rest: 10 PM-6 AM; Work: 9 AM-12 PM, 2 PM-5 PM; Leisure: 6 AM-9 AM, 12 PM-2 PM, 5 PM-10 PM.\n3.  The citizen's urgent needs (hunger, full inventory).\n4.  Their status (resident, visitor, homeless, employed, etc.).\n5.  Their current location and the availability of relevant places (home, workplace, inns, shops).\n\n**General Priorities (illustrative, exact logic is in the code):**\n*   **Absolute Urgency**: Departure from Venice for Forestieri if conditions are met.\n*   **Physiological Needs**: Eating (from inventory, home, tavern/shop), usually during leisure periods. Emergency fishing for starving Facchini.\n*   **Rest**: If it's rest time for their class, the citizen will seek to sleep (home or inn).\n*   **Work**: If it's work time:\n    *   Deposit full inventory at work.\n    *   Go to work if not already there.\n    *   Once at work: construction tasks, production, restocking, fishing (Facchini), management (Cittadini/Forestieri).\n*   **Leisure/Consumption**: If it's leisure time:\n    *   Shopping (food or other goods).\n    *   Other leisure activities (not yet implemented in detail).\n*   **Business Management** (for `RunBy`): Check business status if not done recently, during active hours.\n*   **Inactivity (`idle`)**: If no other activity is appropriate or possible.\n\n### Pathfinding for Travel Activities\n\nTravel activities use the TransportService to calculate realistic paths:\n\n1. Determine the start point (citizen's current location)\n2. Determine the end point (destination building)\n3. Use the transport API to find the optimal path\n4. Store the path coordinates in the activity record\n5. Calculate the expected arrival time based on distance and travel mode\n\n### Activity Visualization\n\nThe frontend can visualize citizen activities by:\n- Displaying citizens at their current locations\n- Animating movement along travel paths\n- Showing appropriate icons for different activity types\n- Providing activity information in the citizen detail view\n\n## AI and Human Citizen Integration\n\nThe activity system treats AI and human citizens identically:\n\n1. **Unified Activity Model**: Both AI and human citizens use the same activity data structure and follow the same rules\n2. **Shared Visualization**: All citizens appear on the map and can be observed performing their activities\n3. **Equal Scheduling**: The activity creation system schedules activities for all citizens regardless of whether they are AI or human\n4. **Economic Impact**: Activities for both AI and human citizens have the same economic effects (e.g., working generates income)\n5. **Interaction Opportunities**: Human players can encounter and interact with AI citizens performing their activities\n\nThe key difference is that AI citizens have their activities automatically determined by the system, while human players can potentially override certain activities through direct gameplay actions. This integration creates a seamless world where AI and human citizens coexist and follow the same daily patterns.\n\n## Integration with Other Systems\n\nThe activity system integrates with several other game systems:\n\n### Housing System\n\n- When citizens are assigned new housing, they need to travel to their new homes\n- Housing quality affects rest effectiveness\n- Housing location affects travel times to work and other destinations\n\n### Employment System\n\n- Citizens travel to their workplaces during work hours\n- Work activities generate income for businesses\n- Job locations affect citizens' daily travel patterns\n\n### Time System\n\n- Activities are scheduled based on the in-game time\n- Day/night cycle affects which activities are appropriate\n- Activity durations are calculated based on realistic timeframes\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nPlanned enhancements to the activity system include:\n\n1. **Social Activities**: Citizens visiting friends or attending social gatherings\n2. **Shopping**: Citizens visiting contracts to purchase goods\n3. **Religious Activities**: Church attendance and religious ceremonies\n4. **Entertainment**: Visiting taverns, theaters, and other entertainment venues\n5. **Seasonal Activities**: Special activities during festivals and holidays\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with the activity system:\n\n1. **Citizens stuck in idle**: May indicate pathfinding failures or missing home/work assignments\n2. **Overlapping activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script runs before previous activities complete\n3. **Invalid paths**: May result from changes to the map or building data\n4. **Missing activities**: Can occur if the activity creation script fails to run on schedule\n\nTo resolve these issues, check the activity creation logs and ensure all related systems (housing, employment, transport) are functioning correctly.\n\n## API-Driven Activity Creation\n\nRefer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the\n`POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and\n`POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity\nchain).\n\n### Managing Simultaneous and Sequential Activities\n\nThe system manages citizen activities as follows:\n\n1. **Simultaneous Activities**: The system generally does not allow a citizen to have multiple simultaneous activities. When an activity is in progress (the current time is between its `StartDate` and `EndDate`), the `createActivities.py` script will not assign a new activity to that citizen.\n\n2. **Activity Chains**: When using `POST /api/activities/try-create` for complex actions (like `manage_public_sell_contract` or `initiate_building_project`), the system creates a chain of sequential activities where:\n   - Each activity in the chain has a `StartDate` equal to the `EndDate` of the previous activity.\n   - All activities in the chain are created at the same time with the status `created`.\n   - If an activity in the chain fails, subsequent activities are automatically marked as `failed`.\n\n3. **Priorities and Interruptions**: Activities created by the engine follow a priority hierarchy (see \"Activity Priorities\" section). However, once an activity is in progress, it is not interrupted by higher-priority activities \u2013 the latter will have to wait until the current activity is completed.\n\n4. **API-Created Activities**: Activities created directly via the API are subject to the same rules \u2013 they cannot be assigned to a citizen who already has an ongoing activity, unless they are explicitly scheduled to start after the current activity ends.\n\n## Citizen Strategic Actions (as Activities)\n\nThis section details the strategic and economic actions citizens can undertake. In line with the\nunified model, **these \"actions\" are initiated as \"activities\" via the `POST /api/activities/try-create` endpoint**.\nEach action listed below will correspond to a specific `activityType`.\n\nInitiation via `try-create` will allow the Python engine to determine the necessary sequence of activities. For example,\na `bid_on_land` action might first generate a travel activity before the bid itself is\nprocessed. Each relevant step in this process will have a record in the `ACTIVITIES` table.\n\nThe `activityType`s listed below are to be used with `POST /api/activities/try-create`. The `activityParameters`\nfor this endpoint will need to contain the specific information for each action.\n\nWhile many actions require visits to specific official buildings (town hall, market, archives, etc.), steps involving direct meetings between citizens (e.g., to discuss an offer, deliver a message, or finalize an informal agreement before official registration) can take place in various city locations. These locations include social gathering places like public baths (`public_bath`), if that's where the concerned citizens are or choose to meet. In such cases, the `targetBuildingId` for the travel activity (`goto_location`) can be the identifier of this meeting place (e.g., the ID of a `public_bath`).\n\n### Land and Real Estate Management\n\n1.  **Make an Offer on Land**\n    *   **activityType**: `bid_on_land` (Old system, may be deprecated or adapted for complex auctions)\n    *   **Description**: The citizen physically travels to an official location to submit an offer.\n    *   **New Land Offer System**:\n        *   **`list_land_for_sale`**: The owner lists their land for sale.\n            *   **Parameters**: `landId`, `price`, `sellerUsername`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (e.g., to `town_hall`), then `finalize_list_land_for_sale` which creates a `land_listing` contract.\n        *   **`make_offer_for_land`**: A citizen makes an offer for a piece of land.\n            *   **Required Parameters**: `landId`, `offerPrice` (or `bidAmount`).\n            *   **Engine-Determined Parameters**: `fromBuildingId` (based on citizen's current position), `targetOfficeBuildingId` (nearest official office, e.g., `town_hall`, `courthouse`), `sellerUsername` (current owner of `landId`, or \"ConsiglioDeiDieci\" if unowned).\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to the determined `targetOfficeBuildingId`), then `finalize_make_offer_for_land` (which is an alias for `submit_land_bid`) that creates a `building_bid` contract (implicitly of type `land_offer`).\n        *   **`accept_land_offer`**: The owner accepts a purchase offer.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_offer`), `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_accept_land_offer` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.\n        *   **`buy_listed_land`**: A buyer purchases land at the listed price.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId` (of the `land_listing`), `landId`, `price`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_buy_listed_land` which updates the contract, transfers ownership and funds.\n        *   **`cancel_land_listing`**: The owner cancels their sale listing.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_listing` which cancels the contract.\n        *   **`cancel_land_offer`**: The offeror cancels their purchase offer.\n            *   **Parameters**: `contractId`, `landId`.\n            *   **Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location`, then `execute_cancel_land_offer` which cancels the contract.\n\n2.  **Buy Available Land (from the State)**\n    *   **activityType**: `buy_available_land`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen travels to an official location (e.g., `town_hall`) to purchase unowned land.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates `goto_location` (to `town_hall`), then `finalize_land_purchase` which handles the transaction.\n    *   **Expected Parameters**: `landId`, `expectedPrice`, `targetBuildingId` (ID of the `town_hall`).\n\n3.  **Initiate a Building Construction Project**\n    *   **activityType**: `initiate_building_project`\n    *   **Description**: The citizen goes to the land plot (`landId`) to obtain a building permit (for a fee), or to a `masons_lodge` / `master_builders_workshop` to submit plans and\nlaunch the project, which may involve application fees or a down payment.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`) to the land for inspection. Upon arrival, an inspection activity (`activityType: inspect_land_plot`, short duration) is created. Then, another travel activity (`activityType: goto_location`, `targetBuildingId`: ID of the `town_hall` or builder's workshop) is created.

Membership fees or dues may be owed to the guild.\n    *   **Main Mechanism**: Creates a `goto_location` activity (to the `guildHallBuildingId` which is a\n`guild_hall`). Upon arrival, a `perform_guild_membership_action` activity is created, and payments to the guild are made if necessary.\n    *   **Expected Parameters (for `activityParameters` in `try-create`)**: `guildId`, `membershipAction` (\"join\",\n\"leave\", \"accept_invite\"), `guildHallBuildingId` (ID of the specific `guild_hall`).\n    *   **Implementation**: Complete. The processor handles the three types of membership actions, entry fees for \"join\", and appropriate notifications.\n\n### Process:\n\n1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:\n    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.\n    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.\n    *   `title`: A concise title for the activity.\n    *   `description`: A brief description of what the activity entails.\n    *   `thought`: A first-person narrative from the citizen about this activity.\n    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.\n        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (si utilis\u00e9 pour une activit\u00e9 de voyage unique) appellera alors en interne `/api/transport` pour d\u00e9terminer le chemin et la dur\u00e9e.\n    *   `notes` (optional): Internal notes or non-displayed information.\n2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload for a single activity.\n3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path. If pathfinding fails, an error is returned.\n4.  **Airtable Record Creation**: If validation and any necessary internal pathfinding succeed, a new activity record is created in the `ACTIVITIES` table with `Status: \"created\"`. The `Path`, `StartDate`, and `EndDate` fields are populated based on the pathfinding results. `Title`, `Description`, `Thought`, and `Notes` are also saved.\n5.  **Engine Processing**: The standard `processActivities.py` script will eventually pick up this \"created\" activity when its `EndDate` is reached and execute its corresponding processor logic to finalize its effects. Il ne cr\u00e9era pas d'activit\u00e9 de suivi.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\n-   **Unguided AI**: Allows AI agents to have fine-grained control over their actions, enabling more complex or emergent behaviors.\n-   **External Tools**: Could allow other tools or game masters to inject specific activities into the simulation.\n-   **Player-Initiated Complex Actions (Future)**: Could potentially be used by the UI to initiate complex, multi-step actions that are best defined as a specific activity.\n\n### Utility Endpoint: `POST /api/try-read`\n\nTo simplify common data retrieval tasks for AI agents, a utility endpoint `POST /api/try-read` is available. This endpoint allows an AI to request predefined GET operations using a simple JSON payload.\n\n**Request Body Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"requestType\": \"get_my_profile\",\n  \"parameters\": { \"username\": \"NLR\" }\n}\n```\n\n**Supported `requestType` values include:**\n`get_my_profile`, `get_my_lands`, `get_my_buildings`, `get_my_inventory`, `get_my_active_sell_contracts`, `get_my_active_import_contracts`, `get_my_problems`, `get_my_opportunities`, `get_my_latest_activity`, `get_lands_for_sale`, `get_building_types`, `get_resource_types`, `get_public_builders`, `get_stocked_public_sell_contracts`, `get_global_thoughts`, `get_citizen_thoughts`, `get_all_guilds`, `get_active_decrees`, `get_ledger`, `get_building_details`, `get_building_resources`, `get_land_details`, `get_problem_details`.\n\nEach `requestType` may require specific fields within the `parameters` object (e.g., `username`, `buildingId`). Refer to the main API Reference for details on each underlying GET request.\n\nThis endpoint internally calls the relevant GET API and returns its response, wrapped in a success/error structure. It helps abstract away the specific URL construction and parameter formatting for common queries.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n-   The client (AI) is responsible for providing correct building IDs for travel when using `POST /api/actions/create-activity`. The server handles the pathfinding.\n-   This method bypasses the prioritized decision logic of `citizen_general_activities.py`.\n-   Care must be taken to avoid conflicts if both engine-driven and API-driven activity creation are active for the same citizen.\n\nRefer to the API Reference (`components/Documentation/ApiReference.tsx`) for the detailed payload structure of the `POST /api/actions/create-activity` endpoint (for direct creation of a single activity when all details are known) and `POST /api/activities/try-create` (for AI-initiated endeavors where the engine will build the necessary activity chain).\n\n### Process:\n\n1.  **Client-Side Decision**: The client (e.g., KinOS AI) determines the full details of the activity to be created. This includes:\n    *   `citizenUsername`: The target citizen.\n    *   `activityType`: The specific type of activity.\n    *   `activityDetails`: A JSON object containing all necessary parameters for that activity type.\n        *   For travel-related activities (e.g., `goto_work`, `goto_home`, `fetch_resource` from a specific building), the client should provide `toBuildingId` and `fromBuildingId` (if applicable) within `activityDetails`. The `/api/actions/create-activity` endpoint will then internally call `/api/transport` to determine the path and timing. The client no longer needs to provide `pathData`.\n2.  **API Request**: The client sends a POST request to `/api/actions/create-activity` with the composed payload.\n3.  **Server Validation & Pathfinding**: The API endpoint validates the payload. If it's a travel activity requiring pathfinding between specified buildings, the server attempts to find a path. If pathfinding fails, an error is returned.\n4.  **Airtable Record Creation**: If validation and any necessary internal pathfinding succeed, a new activity record is created in the `ACTIVITIES` table with `Status: \"created\"`. The `Path`, `StartDate`, and `EndDate` fields are populated based on the pathfinding results.\n5.  **Engine Processing**: The standard `processActivities.py` script will eventually pick up this \"created\" activity and execute its corresponding processor logic.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\n-   **Unguided AI**: Allows AI agents to have fine-grained control over their actions, enabling more complex or emergent behaviors.\n-   **External Tools**: Could allow other tools or game masters to inject specific activities into the simulation.\n-   **Player-Initiated Complex Actions (Future)**: Could potentially be used by the UI to initiate complex, multi-step actions that are best defined as a specific activity.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n-   The client (AI) is responsible for providing correct building IDs for travel.
