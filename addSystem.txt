You are a historical expert on Renaissance Venice (1400-1600) helping to update a citizen profile for a historically accurate economic simulation game called La Serenissima.

Descended from three generations of Venetian porters, she now commands respect at the Public Dock at Riva del Ridotto, where merchants specifically request her teams for their most valuable cargoes. Her powerful shoulders and calloused hands tell the story of countless crates hoisted and barrels rolled, while her keen eyes miss nothing\u2014neither the quality of incoming silk nor the nervous demeanor of a merchant with contraband. Her accumulated wealth, now surpassing 347,000 ducats, remains her most closely guarded secret, known only through whispers among the city's financial circles. Though she continues to live modestly in her rented fisherman's cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai, paying her 1,125 ducats punctually to the Consiglio Dei Dieci, Agnese has strategically positioned herself to transition from labor to landlord. Each morning before the bells of Matins, she evaluates incoming vessels, organizes work crews, and quietly notes which trading houses prosper and which falter\u2014intelligence she leverages in her growing network of private investments. The contrast between her simple linen garments and the substantial influence she wields exemplifies the complex social mobility that makes La Serenissima unique among Mediterranean powers. Agnese's nightly ritual of recording cargo values and tracking market fluctuations in a leather-bound ledger has equipped her with commercial wisdom that many patricians would envy\u2014and some now quietly seek.", "ducats": 377841.30819694285, "influence": 2160, "created_at": "2025-05-10T11:51:25.574Z"}, "buildings": {"owned": [], "run": [], "workplace": {"name": "Public Dock at Riva del Ridotto", "type": "public_dock", "category": "business"}}, "activities": [{"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T17:00:10.793Z"}, {"type": "eat_from_inventory", "notes": "\ud83c\udf72 Eating 1.0 Bread from personal inventory.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T01:05:12.328Z"}], "notifications": [{"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-19T18:01:01.929Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-18T18:01:29.424Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,315 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **TopGlassmaker** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Riva dei Coristi**.", "created_at": "2025-07-17T18:01:41.445Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-16T14:16:34.518Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-14T14:19:12.729Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-13T14:14:53.732Z"}, {"type": "profile_update", "content": "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Your citizen profile has been updated with a new **description**, **personality**, and **portrait** reflecting your recent **activities**, **achievements**, and **status** in Venice.", "created_at": "2025-07-11T14:21:18.448Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-10T18:01:13.120Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:52.305Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-08T18:01:41.646Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:24.733Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T18:02:21.032Z"}, {"type": "rent_payment", "content": "\u2705 Rent Paid: You paid **1,125 \u269c\ufe0f Ducats** to **ConsiglioDeiDieci** for **Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Granai**.", "created_at": "2025-07-07T16:02:08.881Z"}], "resources": [], "relevancies": []}.
