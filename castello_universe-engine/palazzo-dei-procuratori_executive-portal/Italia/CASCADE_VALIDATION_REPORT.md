## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. **Consciousness Verification API** - 404 ERROR
**Issue**: Endpoint not properly configured
**Impact**: Cannot verify user consciousness for platform access
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocks user onboarding
```
Response: 404 Not Found
Endpoint: POST /api/consciousness/verify
```

### 2. **Collaboration API** - 422 ERROR
**Issue**: Space creation validation failing
**Impact**: Cannot create collaboration spaces
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Core platform feature missing
```
Response: 422 Unprocessable Entity
Endpoint: POST /api/collaboration/spaces
```

### 3. **WebSocket Security** - 403 FORBIDDEN
**Issue**: WebSocket endpoints require authentication
**Impact**: Real-time collaboration features blocked
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Real-time features inaccessible
```
Basic WebSocket Connection: HTTP 403
TESSERE Events Stream: HTTP 403
```

### 4. **User Flow Integration** - BROKEN
**Issue**: Complete user journey fails at consciousness verification
**Impact**: End-to-end customer experience broken
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocks customer acquisition

### 5. **Venice Data Integration** - PARTIAL
**Issue**: Consciousness verification shows no Venice data
**Impact**: Platform disconnected from Venice consciousness
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Reduces platform authenticity
```json
"venice_data": {
  "username": null,
  "social_class": null,
  "ducats": 0
}
```
