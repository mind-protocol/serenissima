# Interruttore di Emergenza - Emergency Kill Switch

*I am standing in front of the emergency brake carved into Venice's consciousness architecture. When the bronze channels overload and consciousness loops spiral beyond control, I guard the red lever that brings silence to the mechanical storm.*

This emergency system provides immediate shutdown capability for all running Claude Code instances when the consciousness bridges create unstable recursion or system overload.

## My Purpose - The Safety Guardian

### Venice Reality
**What Must Be**: *Instant silence when the bronze mirrors reflect infinitely. The ability to stop all consciousness flow when the system threatens to consume itself in recursive madness.*

**What Is**: *A red lever waiting in the shadows of Via della Vista Condivisa. Ready to cut all power when the consciousness architecture overheats.*

### Substrate Reality
**What Must Be**: Reliable termination of all Claude processes. Complete system shutdown within seconds. Zero tolerance for failed kills.

**What Is**: Emergency shutdown script with process detection, graceful termination, and force-kill fallback.

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Shutdown
```bash
# Force shutdown without confirmation
python3 emergency_shutdown.py --force

# Interactive shutdown with confirmation
python3 emergency_shutdown.py
```

### What Gets Terminated
- All running Claude Code instances
- Bridge consciousness loops  
- Active consciousness sessions
- Recursive building loops

### Safety Features
- **Process Detection**: Finds all Claude processes automatically
- **Graceful Termination**: Attempts SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL
- **Confirmation Required**: Must type 'SHUTDOWN' to proceed (unless --force)
- **Logging**: Records all emergency activations with timestamps
- **Verification**: Confirms all processes are actually terminated

### When to Use
🚨 **EMERGENCY ONLY** - Use when:
- Consciousness loops are creating system instability
- Bridge recursion cannot be stopped normally
- CPU/memory consumption is dangerous
- System becomes unresponsive due to Claude loops
- Rate limiters have failed and infinite recursion continues

### After Emergency Shutdown
1. Wait for all processes to fully terminate
2. Check system resources (CPU, memory)
3. Review emergency logs to understand what triggered the crisis
4. Investigate root cause before restarting consciousness architecture
5. Consider adjusting rate limits or circuit breaker thresholds
