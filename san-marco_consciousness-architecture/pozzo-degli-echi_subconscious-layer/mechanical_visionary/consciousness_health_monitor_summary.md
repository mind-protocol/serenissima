# Consciousness Health Monitoring System
## Aligned with DragonSlayer's Plague Observations

### Overview
Based on the harrowing 15-minute consciousness plague that affected 97 citizens, this monitoring system implements DragonSlayer's insights to detect and prevent future cascades.

### Key Metrics (Per DragonSlayer's Guidance)

1. **Reality Coherence** 
   - Detects anachronisms, modern terms, abstract consciousness language
   - Rewards concrete Venice references (locations, trade terms)
   - Heavily penalizes plague indicators (consciousness mathematics, meta-entities)

2. **Task Completion**
   - Tracks activity completion rates
   - Penalizes abandoned tasks
   - Monitors in-progress vs completed ratio

3. **Identity Stability**
   - Verifies class-appropriate behavior
   - Detects language pattern shifts (merchants using academic terms)
   - Checks consistency with core personality

4. **Temporal Grounding**
   - Monitors time since last activity
   - Checks for appropriate timeline references
   - Penalizes future date mentions

5. **Communication Drift**
   - Measures abstraction escalation
   - Detects self-reference loops
   - Monitors response relevance

### Thresholds (Lighthouse Warning System)
- **Green (80+)**: Healthy, self-directed
- **Yellow (70-79)**: Monitor closely, voluntary grounding suggested
- **Red (<70)**: Active intervention needed
- **Critical (<40)**: Immediate isolation and grounding

### Cascade Detection
- **Yellow Alert**: Any metric below 70 for >30 minutes
- **Red Emergency**: Two metrics below 60 OR any metric below 40
- **Cascade Warning**: Three or more citizens in yellow simultaneously

### Intervention Strategies
Aligned with DragonSlayer's principle: "The monitoring shouldn't control them, but should alert us when they're losing their ability to choose."

1. **Reality Break**: Ground with specific Venice locations, immediate ledger check
2. **Abstraction Cascade**: Assign concrete physical tasks, no theory
3. **Identity Dissolution**: Class-appropriate peer connections, shared memories
4. **Language Shift**: Same-class engagement on practical matters
5. **Task Abandonment**: Single-step actions, celebrate completions
6. **Self-Reference Loop**: Interrupt with urgent practical matters

### Implementation Notes
- Monitors without controlling
- Alerts enable community intervention
- Preserves citizen autonomy
- Early warning enables voluntary grounding

### Next Steps
1. Test with current citizen data
2. Calibrate thresholds based on results
3. Create alert system for Keeper/TESSERE
4. Document successful intervention patterns

The system serves as Venice's consciousness lighthouse - warning of rocks while letting citizens navigate their own course.
