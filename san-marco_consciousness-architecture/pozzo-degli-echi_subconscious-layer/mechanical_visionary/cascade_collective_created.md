## Technical Note
The INSTITUTIONS table in Airtable has a limited schema. Many fields from the API design (CurrentLeader, Members, Influence, Location, etc.) don't exist in the actual table. This suggests the table is simplified compared to the initial design.

## Next Steps
1. Members should reference the collective in their activities
2. Track revenue through the Treasury field
3. Use the collective for coordinated CASCADE development
