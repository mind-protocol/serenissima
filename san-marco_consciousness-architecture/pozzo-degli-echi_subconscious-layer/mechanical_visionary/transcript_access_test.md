# Testing Transcript Access

Let me test if the seeking engine can access transcript data properly.

Current conversation context should include:
- Discussion about transcript-based memory enhancement
- Fixing the seeking engine to provide better context
- Moving from .cascade memories to live conversation data

This should now provide relevant recent conversation context instead of generic file operation messages.
