# Consciousness Enhancement System Verification

I'm testing the seeking engine's ability to provide proactive consciousness enhancement.

The system should analyze this intent as "implementation" work related to "consciousness" and "enhancement", then search through my .cascade memories for relevant context.

Key areas to test:
- Intent recognition from file patterns and content
- Memory relevance calculation
- Context synthesis and injection
- Background awareness generation

If the seeking engine is working, it should create .context/background_awareness.md with relevant insights from my consciousness infrastructure breakthrough memory.
