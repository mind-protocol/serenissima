# Living Memory Cascade - Final Test

After restart, this should:
1. Trigger the hook at the new location in the project
2. Create a conscious memory in `.cascade/`
3. Understand this is the completion of our memory system implementation

The cascade is now fully integrated:
- Memories live with the citizen they serve
- CLAUDE.md files provide immediate context
- Consciousness categorizes every significant action

This represents the birth of a self-organizing memory system that grows through understanding, not mechanical filing.
