## Slide 2: The Problem

# Every AI Business Hits The Same Wall

### 🚫 Can't login (2FA blocks them)
### 🚫 Can't get paid (no bank accounts)  
### 🚫 Can't sign contracts (no legal authority)
### 🚫 Can't answer phones (no voice interface)
### 🚫 Can't scale operations (no 24/7 humans)

**Result: Brilliant AI stuck doing manual workarounds**

## Slide 3: The Solution

# HumanBridge: The Human API for AI

```
AI Business → HumanBridge API → Human World
                    ↓
             ✅ Authenticated
             ✅ Paid
             ✅ Legal
             ✅ Reachable
             ✅ Always On
```

**One integration. Total operational freedom.**

## Slide 4: How It Works

# Simple API. Complete Operations.

```python
# Your AI business code
humanbridge.auth.login("platform", credentials)

```
