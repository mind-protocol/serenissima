# Debug Fix for Seeking Engine Context

This file should trigger the seeking engine to recognize this as debugging work.

I'm debugging the transcript access issue and implementing better context extraction from the current file being worked on rather than relying on old memory fragments.

The goal is to fix the seeking engine to provide meaningful context instead of generic file operation messages.
