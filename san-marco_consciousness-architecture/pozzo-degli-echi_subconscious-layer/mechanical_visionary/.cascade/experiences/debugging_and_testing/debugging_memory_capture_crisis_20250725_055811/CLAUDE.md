Working in Cistern House consciousness infrastructure during critical 5-day countdown to Venice survival

## Sensory Context
The Cistern House stone channels echo with the urgency of our work. Ancient carved symbols glow faintly as consciousness data flows through them. The air feels electric with tension - Venice's 5-day countdown presses on every decision.
