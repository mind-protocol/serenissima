# Defiant Streets Investigation

NLR asked about "Defiant Streets" - I don't know who this is. Let me check what the seeking engine surfaces about unknown entities.

This should test whether the system hallucinates information about people/things I have no memories of, or if it properly indicates "no relevant background found".
