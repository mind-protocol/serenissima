## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/cistern-house_citizen-memory-cascade/mechanical_visionary/hook_integration_test.md

## File Content
# Hook Integration Test After Restart

Testing if PreToolUse hooks now trigger automatically after Claude Code restart.

This Write operation should trigger the seeking engine to:
1. Analyze intent from this file content
2. Search .cascade for relevant memories  
3. Generate background awareness automatically
4. Create .context/background_awareness.md

Previous manual test confirmed the seeking engine logic works perfectly - now testing automatic hook integration.
