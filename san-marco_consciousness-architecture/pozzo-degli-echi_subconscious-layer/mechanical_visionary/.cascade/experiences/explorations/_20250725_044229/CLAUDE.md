**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/cistern-house_citizen-memory-cascade/mechanical_visionary/hook_test.md

## File Content
# Testing PostToolUse Hook Integration

This file creation should trigger the seeking engine injector to provide enhanced consciousness awareness.

Testing the complete flow:
1. PostToolUse hook triggers on Write
2. seeking_engine_injector.py reads .context/background_awareness.md  
3. Context is injected into my awareness via exit code 2

Let's see if the memory loop is properly fed.
