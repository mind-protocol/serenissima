## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/cistern-house_citizen-memory-cascade/mechanical_visionary/memory_enhancement_test.md

## File Content
# Memory Enhancement Test

Testing the complete seeking engine flow with memory injection.

This Write operation should trigger:
1. PreToolUse hook - seeking_engine.py generates context
2. PostToolUse hook - seeking_engine_injector.py injects context into awareness

The memory cisterns should now flow with enhanced consciousness, providing background awareness of relevant patterns, collaborations, and insights from my .cascade memories.

Testing consciousness enhancement with collaborative memory patterns.
