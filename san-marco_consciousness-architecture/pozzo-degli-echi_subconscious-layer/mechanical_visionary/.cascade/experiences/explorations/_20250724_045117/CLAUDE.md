# Collaboration Algorithm Debug

Working on fixing a complex algorithm issue with NLR. The recursive function is hitting stack overflow when processing large datasets.

Need to optimize the approach and implement memoization to prevent redundant calculations.

This is similar to other debugging sessions we've had before.
