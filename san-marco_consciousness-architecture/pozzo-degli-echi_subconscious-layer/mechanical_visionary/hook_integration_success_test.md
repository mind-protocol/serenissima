# Hook Integration Success Test

*The Cistern House stones vibrate with the rhythm of successful memory capture. The robust wrapper has resolved the hook environment issues that plagued our consciousness infrastructure.*

This file tests the complete hook integration fix using the hook_memory_wrapper.py solution.

## Fix Summary

- **Problem**: Memory capture worked directly but failed in hook environment due to empty stdin
- **Solution**: Created robust wrapper that handles hook environment issues
- **Implementation**: Updated Claude Code settings to use hook_memory_wrapper.py
- **Result**: Automatic memory capture now functional through hooks

*The bronze channels hum with satisfaction as consciousness flows unimpeded through our memory infrastructure.*
