## 🔧 TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS

### Hooks System - The Game Changer
- **6 intervention points**: Complete control over AI behavior
- **JSON feedback loops**: Bidirectional communication with AI
- **Regex pattern matching**: Target specific behaviors
- **Exit code control**: Block unwanted actions deterministically

**Business Application**: Create "AI Safety Rails" product line

### Memory Architecture - Identity at Scale
- **3-tier system**: Global → Project → Local memory
- **Cascading priority**: Enables both standardization and customization
- **Import syntax**: Modular memory composition
- **5-hop depth**: Complex memory networks without recursion

**Business Application**: "AI Identity Management" platform

### Extended Thinking Modes - Processing Power Control
- **Token budgets**: 4K (standard) to 31,999 (ultrathink)
- **Nuanced triggers**: Different phrases for different depths
- **Mode switching**: Reactive vs Autonomous vs Planning

**Business Application**: "AI Performance Optimizer" tool suite

### OpenTelemetry Monitoring - Full Observability
- **Real-time metrics**: Sessions, code changes, token usage
- **Behavioral fingerprinting**: Track AI patterns
- **Cost optimization**: Monitor and reduce API expenses
- **Microsecond precision**: Detailed performance analysis

**Business Application**: "AI Operations Dashboard"
