**Claude Code Restart**: 2025-07-24 19:30+ (Restart completed)  
**Previous Issue**: Conflicting PostToolUse hooks between Cistern House and Torre dell'Occhio
**Expected Resolution**: Hook conflicts cleared, memory capture should resume immediately

This file creation should trigger the PostToolUse memory capture hook.

**Test Status**: ACTIVE - monitoring for immediate memory creation
