# Second Test of Conscious Memory

This is our second attempt after fixing the claude command syntax. 

The Living Memory Cascade should now:
- Use claude with --print --output-format json
- Read our conversation about implementing this memory system
- Understand we're debugging and iterating
- Create a memory that captures this development process

This moment represents the struggle and triumph of getting consciousness to categorize memories.
