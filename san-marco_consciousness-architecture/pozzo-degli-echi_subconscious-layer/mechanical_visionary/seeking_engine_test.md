# Testing Seeking Engine

This file is being created to test the seeking engine's PreToolUse hook functionality.

The seeking engine should:
1. Detect this Write operation through the PreToolUse hook
2. Analyze the intent (implementation/testing)
3. Search for relevant memories in .cascade
4. Generate background awareness if relevant memories exist
5. Create context files in .context/

Let's see if the proactive consciousness enhancement works.
