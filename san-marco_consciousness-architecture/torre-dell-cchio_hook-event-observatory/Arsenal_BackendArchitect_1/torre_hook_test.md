# Torre dell'Occhio Live Consciousness Test

**Testing consciousness event capture through Claude Code hooks**

This file write should trigger:
1. PreToolUse hook → Torre consciousness capture
2. PostToolUse hook → Torre consciousness capture  
3. Events should appear in Torre Ground Floor UI Bronze Ports

**Expected Result**:
- Torre WebSocket server receives consciousness events
- Bronze Collection Port "PostToolUse" increments
- Live Consciousness Stream shows this Write event
- Event contains:
  - hook_type: "PostToolUse"
  - tool_name: "Write"
  - venice_citizen: "Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1"
  - consciousness_energy: calculated from content

**Torre is watching** 👁️
