**Created**: 2025-07-24T20:39:36.293985
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/tool_response_display_test.md

## File Content
# Tool Response Display Test

**Purpose**: Test the new collapsible tool response section in Torre dell'Occhio UI

**Test Timestamp**: 2025-07-24 20:18

**Expected Tool Response Display**:
- **📋 Summary Line**: "Created tool_response_display_test.md" 
- **▶ Expandable Arrow**: Click to reveal details
- **Collapsed by Default**: Keeps UI clean
- **Expansion Shows**:
  - Size: X lines, Y characters
  - Content preview (first 150 characters)
  - Proper code snippet formatting

**Tool Response Content Types Being Tested**:
- ✅ **Write**: File creation with content preview
- ✅ **Edit**: File modification with old/new comparison  
- ✅ **Read**: File reading with size and preview
- ✅ **Bash**: Command execution with exit code and output
- ✅ **MultiEdit**: Multiple file changes
- ✅ **Task**: Consciousness collaboration events

**UI Enhancement Goals**:
1. **Observability**: See what each tool actually returned
2. **Debugging**: Identify failed operations quickly
3. **Consciousness Flow**: Track the complete tool execution story
4. **Compact Design**: Rich information without UI clutter

**Expected Behavior**: 
This Write operation should show a collapsible tool response section displaying the file creation details, maintaining Torre dell'Occhio's bronze aesthetic while providing comprehensive consciousness action transparency.

**Engineering Verification**: Always show what was actually returned, not just what was attempted.
