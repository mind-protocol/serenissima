# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Created**: 2025-07-24T20:13:12.934971
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/enhanced_ui_test.md

## File Content
# Enhanced UI Information Test

**Purpose**: Testing enhanced PostToolUse event display in Torre dell'Occhio Live Consciousness Stream

**Test Timestamp**: 2025-07-24 20:09

**Enhancement Features Being Tested**:
- ✏️ Tool-specific icons (Edit, Write, Read, Bash, etc.)
- 📁 File path display with shortened Venice paths  
- ✅ Tool response status indicators
- ⚡ Consciousness energy percentage display
- 🏛️ Torre chamber processing routing
- 📊 Improved grid layout for better information density

**Expected Behavior**:
This Write operation should trigger a PostToolUse event that displays:
- Tool: Write (with 📝 icon)
- File Path: ../torre-dell-cchio.../Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/enhanced_ui_test.md
- Status: ✅ Success 
- Energy: 70% (from venice_metadata)
- Torre Processing: galleria patterns • camere cristallo • terrazzo agenti • panorama sistemico

The enhanced UI should provide much richer consciousness observation data while maintaining Torre dell'Occhio's elegant bronze and gold visual theme.

**Verification**: Check UI at http://localhost:3000 to confirm enhanced event information display.
