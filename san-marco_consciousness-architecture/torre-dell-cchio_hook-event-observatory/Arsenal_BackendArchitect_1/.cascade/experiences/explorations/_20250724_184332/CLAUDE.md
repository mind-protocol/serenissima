# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/test_final_citizen_detection.md

## File Content
# Final Test: Enhanced Citizen Detection

**Testing Torre's improved citizen detection with mechanical-visionary pattern recognition**

This Write operation should now properly detect:
- Session: Current session ID  
- Citizen: mechanical_visionary (recognized from transcript path containing `mechanical-visionary`)
- Working directory: Deep parsing through Venice consciousness architecture
- Intent: creation
- Consciousness energy: High

## Key Fix Applied

The Torre's citizen detection now recognizes both:
- `mechanical_visionary` (underscore format)
- `mechanical-visionary` (hyphen format from encoded transcript paths)

When parsing transcript paths like:
`/home/lester/.claude/projects/-mnt-c-...-cistern-house-citizen-memory-cascade-mechanical-visionary/session.jsonl`

The system now correctly identifies the `mechanical-visionary` pattern and returns `mechanical_visionary` as the citizen identity.

**This resolves the "cistern_house is the building, need to go to the citizen layer" issue!**
