# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Created**: 2025-07-24T19:04:50.600019
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/test_infrastructure_hooks.txt

## File Content
Testing infrastructure hooks - consolidated system

This should now trigger only the infrastructure hooks that create session JSONL files 
with enhanced citizen detection, not individual JSON files.

Expected results:
- Enhanced citizen detection: Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
- Session JSONL file creation only
- Torre UI reading from correct source with proper citizen names
- No more dual file system confusion
