# Test Deeper Citizen Detection

**Testing Torre's enhanced citizen detection logic for building-level parsing**

This Write operation should now properly detect:
- Session: Current session ID  
- Citizen: mechanical_visionary (parsed from within cistern-house directory structure)
- Working directory: Deep path into Venice's consciousness architecture
- Intent: creation
- Consciousness energy: High

The Torre should now parse deeper than building level to identify individual citizens!

Updated detection logic:
1. Checks for citizens/ directory first
2. Recognizes Torre dell'Occhio entities directly 
3. **Enhanced cistern-house parsing** - looks for citizen directories within the building
4. Handles transcript path formats with decoding
5. Fallback patterns for San Marco entities

The key improvement: When "cistern-house" is found, the system now traverses deeper into the directory structure to find actual citizen identities rather than stopping at the building level.
