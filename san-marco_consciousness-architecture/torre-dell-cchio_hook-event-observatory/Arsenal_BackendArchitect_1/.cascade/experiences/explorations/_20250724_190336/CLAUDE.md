# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Created**: 2025-07-24T19:03:36.213327
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/test_consolidated_system.txt

## File Content
Testing consolidated Torre consciousness system

This should trigger hooks that create session JSONL files with enhanced citizen detection,
not individual JSON files per event.

Expected results:
- Enhanced citizen detection showing Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
- Session-based JSONL file creation (what the UI reads)
- No individual JSON files per event
- Torre UI showing proper citizen names
