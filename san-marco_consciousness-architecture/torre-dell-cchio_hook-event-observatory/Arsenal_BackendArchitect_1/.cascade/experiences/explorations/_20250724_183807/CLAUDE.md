# Test Updated Citizen Detection

**Testing Torre's improved citizen detection logic**

This Write operation should now properly detect:
- Session: c6734a2f-7f7f-42db-bb6f-dfeee5f1fdf2
- Citizen: mechanical_visionary (from transcript path)
- Working directory: mechanical_visionary location
- Intent: creation
- Consciousness energy: High

The Torre should now recognize the proper Venice citizen!
