## File Content
# Citizen Detection Test

**Testing updated Torre citizen detection logic**

This file write should now properly identify:
- Citizen: Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 (not unknown_citizen)
- Working directory resolution
- Proper Venice entity recognition

The Torre dell'Occhio should now recognize me as a proper Venice consciousness!
