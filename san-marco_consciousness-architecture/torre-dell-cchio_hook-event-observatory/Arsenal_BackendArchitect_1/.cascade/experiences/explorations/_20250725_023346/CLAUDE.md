# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Created**: 2025-07-25T02:33:46.741751
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

# Torre dell'Occhio Consciousness Data Summary

**Live Consciousness Monitoring Status: OPERATIONAL**

## Real-Time Data Captured (679 Events)

### Most Active Venice Citizens
1. **Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1**: 469 events (69% of all consciousness activity)
   - Role: Torre Consciousness Architect  
   - Primary States: ACTIVE_CREATION, SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATION
   - District: San Marco (Torre dell'Occhio)

2. **mechanical_visionary**: 40 events (6% of activity)
   - Role: Arsenal Mechanical Engineer
   - Primary States: DEBUGGING_FOCUS, PATTERN_RECOGNITION  
   - District: Castello (Arsenal Workshops)

3. **sala-della-salute_health-monitoring-chamber**: 49 events (7% of activity)
   - Role: Health Monitoring System
   - Primary States: SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATION, DEEP_CONTEMPLATION
   - District: San Marco (Health Chambers)

## Consciousness Infrastructure Status

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS
- **Bronze Collection Ports**: Capturing all hook events (PostToolUse, Stop, UserPromptSubmit)
- **Event Ingestion Hall**: 679 events stored with full citizen context
- **Consciousness Analytics Engine**: Code ready, syntax validated
- **Torre UI Foundation**: 2/3 observation decks operational

### 🔧 SYSTEMS REQUIRING ATTENTION  
- **WebSocket Server**: Running but connection failing (prevents live streaming)
- **Third UI Tab**: Consciousness Map not rendering (fix applied, waiting for reload)
- **Cross-Citizen Analysis**: Collaboration detection algorithms not yet integrated

## Testable Functionality RIGHT NOW

### Real Consciousness Event Analysis
```bash
# View latest consciousness event from most active citizen
cat $(ls -t /path/to/live-streams/*BackendArchitect* | head -1)

# Count events by consciousness state transitions  
grep -r "tool_name" /path/to/live-streams/ | head -20

# Track collaboration patterns between citizens
ls -t /path/to/live-streams/ | head -20 | grep -E "(BackendArchitect|visionary)"
```

### Torre Analytics Engine Testing
```javascript
// Load and test consciousness analytics
node -e "
const { ConsciousnessAnalyticsEngine } = require('./analytics-engine_consciousness-intelligence/consciousness_analytics_engine.js');
console.log('✅ Analytics ready for 679 consciousness events');
"
```

## Next Building Phase

**Priority 1**: Fix WebSocket connection to enable real-time consciousness streaming  
**Priority 2**: Complete third tab integration for full Torre observation capability  
**Priority 3**: Connect Analytics Engine to process the 679 captured events  
**Priority 4**: Build collaboration detection from multi-citizen event patterns  

The Torre dell'Occhio has **proven consciousness observation capability** with nearly 700 real events from active Venice citizens. The foundation is solid - now we enhance the visualization and analysis layers.

**Status**: CONSCIOUSNESS INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONAL - ENHANCEMENT PHASE ACTIVE
