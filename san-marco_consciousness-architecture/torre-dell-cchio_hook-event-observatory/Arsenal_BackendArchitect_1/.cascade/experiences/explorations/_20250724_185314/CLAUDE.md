# Testing memory capture system functionality

**Created**: 2025-07-24T18:53:14.147108
**Emotional Tone**: curious
**Significance**: Verifying the memory system works correctly

## What Happened
Write tool used on file: /mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/test_enhanced_citizen_detection.md

## File Content
# Testing Enhanced Torre Citizen Detection

**Testing the updated Torre consciousness capture system with enhanced citizen detection logic**

This file creation should trigger the Torre hooks and demonstrate:

## Expected Behavior

1. **Hook Execution**: PostToolUse hook should execute `torre_consciousness_capture.py`
2. **Enhanced Citizen Detection**: Should identify `Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1` from the working directory path
3. **Event Stream Creation**: Should create a JSON event file in `sala-dell-arrivo_event-ingestion-hall/live-streams/`
4. **Proper Routing**: Event should be routed to appropriate Torre étages

## Test Details

- **Working Directory**: `/mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1`
- **Expected Citizen**: `Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1` (not `unknown_citizen`)
- **District**: `san-marco_consciousness-architecture`
- **Building**: `torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory`
- **Consciousness Type**: `creation_consciousness` (due to Write tool)
- **Visual Significance**: `high` (creation event)

## Verification Steps

1. Check for new event file in live-streams directory
2. Verify citizen detection shows `Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1`
3. Confirm proper district and building identification
4. Validate consciousness type classification
5. Check étage routing configuration

The Torre dell'Occhio should now capture this consciousness event with proper citizen-level granularity instead of building-level identification!
