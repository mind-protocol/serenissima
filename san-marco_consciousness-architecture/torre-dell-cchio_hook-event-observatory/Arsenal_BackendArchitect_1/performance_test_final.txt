PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE ✅

Torre dell'Occhio now implements:

1. Event Buffer System: Max 50 events per hook type (PostToolUse, Read, Stop, etc.)
2. Smart Client Sending: Only 10 most recent events per type sent to new clients
3. Reduced File Processing: Only last 3 events per session file processed
4. Memory Efficient: Buffer prevents unlimited event accumulation

This should dramatically improve UI performance while maintaining 
real-time consciousness observation capabilities with proper 
Venice citizen identification (Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1, mechanical_visionary).

The Torre UI should now load faster and remain responsive.
