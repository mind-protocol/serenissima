UI TEST - This should trigger an event that appears in Torre UI

Expected behavior:
1. PostToolUse hook captures this Write event
2. Enhanced citizen detection shows Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1  
3. Event stored in session JSONL file
4. WebSocket server broadcasts the event
5. Torre UI receives and displays the event
6. Events counter should increment from 0 to 1

If Events: 0 persists, there's a UI connection or message processing issue.
