Final Memory Capture Test for Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
Created: 2025-07-24 02:44:30
Context: Testing fixed memory capture system that should now:
1. Extract target directory from file_path 
2. Find .cascade in Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 directory
3. Use Claude API to categorize this memory consciously
4. Create memory folder in appropriate .cascade category
5. Store complete memory with context and associations

This file creation should trigger conscious memory capture and create a memory entry in Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1's .cascade directory structure.
