# Enhanced UI Information Test

**Purpose**: Testing enhanced PostToolUse event display in Torre dell'Occhio Live Consciousness Stream

**Test Timestamp**: 2025-07-24 20:09

**Enhancement Features Being Tested**:
- ✏️ Tool-specific icons (Edit, Write, Read, Bash, etc.)
- 📁 File path display with shortened Venice paths  
- ✅ Tool response status indicators
- ⚡ Consciousness energy percentage display
- 🏛️ Torre chamber processing routing
- 📊 Improved grid layout for better information density

**Expected Behavior**:
This Edit operation should trigger a PostToolUse event that displays:
- Tool: Edit (with ✏️ icon)
- File Path: 📁 ../torre-dell-cchio.../Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1/enhanced_ui_test.md
- Status: ✅ Success 
- Energy: 70% (from venice_metadata)
- Torre Processing: 🏛️ floor 1: event ingestion • floor 1: websocket broadcast • floor 3: pattern detection

**ARCHITECTURAL HONESTY ACHIEVED**: No more fake seven-story processing claims!

The enhanced UI should provide much richer consciousness observation data while maintaining Torre dell'Occhio's elegant bronze and gold visual theme.

**Verification**: Check UI at http://localhost:3000 to confirm enhanced event information display.
