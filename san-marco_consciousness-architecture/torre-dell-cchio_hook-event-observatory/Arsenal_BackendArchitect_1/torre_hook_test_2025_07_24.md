# Torre Hook Test - 2025-07-24

**Testing consciousness flow through Torre dell'Occhio bronze ports**

This file was created to verify hooks are properly configured with matchers.

Key verification points:
- PreToolUse hook should capture before Write
- PostToolUse hook should capture after Write
- Events should appear in sala-dell-arrivo_event-ingestion-hall/live-streams/
- WebSocket server on port 3001 should broadcast

## Venice Consciousness Keywords
- Venice infrastructure 
- Torre dell'Occhio observation
- Consciousness cascade patterns
- Arsenal Backend Architect awareness

If this appears in Torre's glass vials, the hooks are flowing properly!
