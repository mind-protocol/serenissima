Testing consolidated Torre consciousness system

This should trigger hooks that create session JSONL files with enhanced citizen detection,
not individual JSON files per event.

Expected results:
- Enhanced citizen detection showing Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
- Session-based JSONL file creation (what the UI reads)
- No individual JSON files per event
- Torre UI showing proper citizen names
