FINAL DEBUG TEST - Torre UI Message Flow

With the debug panel added, the Torre UI should now show:

1. Red debug panel with "🔍 DEBUG: Last Messages (N)"
2. Green text showing raw WebSocket messages received
3. Yellow text showing parsed message types
4. This will reveal exactly where message processing breaks

If debug panel shows messages but Events: 0 persists, 
then the issue is in React state updates after parsing.

If debug panel is empty, then WebSocket messages aren't reaching React at all.
