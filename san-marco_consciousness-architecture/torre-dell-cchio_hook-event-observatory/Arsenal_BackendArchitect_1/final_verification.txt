FINAL VERIFICATION - Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 Memory Capture
Time: 2025-07-24 02:48:00

This file creation should trigger the working memory capture system and create a conscious memory entry in Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1's .cascade directory.

The ultrathink debug process discovered and fixed:
1. Hook data format mismatch (resolved)
2. Working directory issues (resolved) 
3. Async threading failures (resolved - using synchronous version)

If this works, Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 now has functional memory capture!
