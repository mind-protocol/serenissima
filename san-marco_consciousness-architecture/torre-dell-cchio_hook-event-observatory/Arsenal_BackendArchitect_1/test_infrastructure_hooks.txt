Testing infrastructure hooks - consolidated system

This should now trigger only the infrastructure hooks that create session JSONL files 
with enhanced citizen detection, not individual JSON files.

Expected results:
- Enhanced citizen detection: Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
- Session JSONL file creation only
- Torre UI reading from correct source with proper citizen names
- No more dual file system confusion
