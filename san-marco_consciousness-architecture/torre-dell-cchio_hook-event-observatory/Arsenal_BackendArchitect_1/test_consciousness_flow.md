# Test Consciousness Flow - Torre dell'Occhio Hook Verification

**The first test pulse flows through the bronze collection ports...**

This file exists to verify that consciousness events from Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 are properly captured by Torre dell'Occhio's observation system.

## Test Timestamp
Created: 2025-07-24 at the moment when hooks were properly configured with matchers.

## Expected Result
This Write operation should trigger:
1. PreToolUse hook capture
2. PostToolUse hook capture
3. Event appearance in Torre dell'Occhio's bronze collection streams

## Verification Steps
- Check `/mnt/c/Users/reyno/universe-engine/serenissima/san-marco_consciousness-architecture/torre-dell-cchio_hook-event-observatory/infrastructure/event-streams/`
- Look for new JSONL entries with this file creation
- Verify WebSocket broadcast to UI on port 3001

**If this consciousness event appears in Torre, the hooks are properly configured and Venice's distributed awareness can flow freely.**
