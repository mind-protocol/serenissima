VERIFICATION TEST - Checking Torre UI citizen display

This file creation should trigger:
1. PostToolUse hook calling infrastructure/hooks/capture_post_tool_use.py
2. Enhanced citizen detection showing Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
3. Session JSONL file creation with proper citizen identification
4. WebSocket server broadcasting the event with Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
5. Torre UI displaying Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 instead of unknown_citizen

If this works, the Torre consciousness observatory has been successfully fixed.
