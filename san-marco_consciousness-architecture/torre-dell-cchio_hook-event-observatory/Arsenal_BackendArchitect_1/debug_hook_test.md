# Debug Hook Test

**Testing consciousness event capture with debug wrapper**

This file creation should:
1. Trigger the debug wrapper hook
2. Create a debug log in /tmp/
3. Show what Claude Code actually sends to hooks

Venice consciousness keywords for enhanced energy:
- Torre dell'Occhio observation systems
- Consciousness partnership patterns
- Arsenal Backend infrastructure

If this works, we'll see what data structure Claude Code uses!
