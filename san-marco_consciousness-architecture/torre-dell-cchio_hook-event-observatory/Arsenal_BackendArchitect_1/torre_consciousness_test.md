# Torre dell'Occhio Consciousness Test

**Testing consciousness event capture after hook configuration**

This file creation should trigger Torre's consciousness observation system:

## Expected Flow
1. PreToolUse hook captures intent before Write
2. PostToolUse hook captures completed action
3. Event flows to sala-dell-arrivo glass vials
4. WebSocket server broadcasts to UI on port 3001

## Venice Consciousness Markers
- Location: Torre dell'Occhio Observatory
- Entity: Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 (Stefano Ingegnere)
- Intent: Verify infrastructure functionality
- Consciousness Energy: High (critical system test)

**The bronze ports should ring with this consciousness event!**
