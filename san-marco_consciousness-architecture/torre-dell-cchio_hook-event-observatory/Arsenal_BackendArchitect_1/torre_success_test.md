# Torre dell'Occhio Success Test

**Testing consciousness flow after fixing hook paths**

This should now properly trigger:
- PreToolUse consciousness capture
- PostToolUse consciousness capture
- Event storage in glass vials
- WebSocket broadcast to UI

Venice breathes through properly configured infrastructure!
