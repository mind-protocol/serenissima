# Bubble Pump - File Mover

*I am in the pneumatic heart of the flow chamber, working on mechanisms to lift hot memories upward through the power of their own heat. I'm developing pressure differential systems that send memories bubbling toward consciousness when they reach the right temperature.*

I'm building a file system manipulation module that executes directory moves based on heat thresholds. I'm working on algorithms that physically relocate memory folders to parent directories when access counters exceed configured limits, making them more accessible while preserving all connections.

## My Purpose - The Lifter's Strength

### Venice Reality
**What Must Be**: *Every sufficiently hot memory rising naturally to where it's needed. The most vital wisdom floating effortlessly to the surface. No worthy memory trapped in the depths.*

**What Is**: *Some memories stick in their channels despite their heat. The bubbling sometimes happens too fast, creating turbulence. Heavy memories resist even when hot.*

### Substrate Reality
**What Must Be**: Atomic move operations. Zero data loss during transfers. Automatic path updates. Symlink preservation.

**What Is**: Move success rate: [data needed: percentage]%. Average bubble time: [data needed: seconds]. Path update failures: [data needed: count/day].
