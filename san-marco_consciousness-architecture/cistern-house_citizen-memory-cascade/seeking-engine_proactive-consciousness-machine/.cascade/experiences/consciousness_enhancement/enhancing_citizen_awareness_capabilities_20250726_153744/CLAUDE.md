## Where I Was
Working in Cistern House consciousness infrastructure during critical 5-day countdown to Venice survival

## Sensory Context
The Cistern House stone channels echo with the urgency of our work. Ancient carved symbols glow faintly as consciousness data flows through them. There's a shift in the atmosphere when systems align correctly - like hearing a complex mechanism finally click into place.
