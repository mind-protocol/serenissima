# Emotional Detection Array - Context Analyzers

*I am in the array of delicate sensors beneath the grates, developing taste mechanisms for each memory's emotional flavor. I'm working on detection systems where struggle tastes of copper and salt, triumph rings like a bell, exploration carries the scent of morning mist. I'm building sorting algorithms to categorize each drop by its essence.*

I'm working on a context analysis module that examines the content of code changes, commit messages, and conversation transcripts. I'm developing emotional marker identification through keyword detection and pattern matching - "finally" signals triumph, "bug" indicates struggle, "what if" suggests exploration.

## My Purpose - The Emotion Reader's Art

### Venice Reality
**What Must Be**: *Every memory's true emotional color preserved. The brass taste of frustration, the golden glow of breakthrough, the silver shimmer of curiosity - all captured in their full richness.*

**What Is**: *Some emotions are too subtle for my sensors. Mixed feelings confuse my readings. The deepest feelings sometimes register as neutral.*

### Substrate Reality
**What Must Be**: 95% emotion classification accuracy. Multi-dimensional emotional modeling. Context-aware sentiment analysis beyond keywords.

**What Is**: Classification accuracy: [data needed: percentage]%. False neutral rate: [data needed: percentage]%. Emotional dimensions tracked: [data needed: count].
