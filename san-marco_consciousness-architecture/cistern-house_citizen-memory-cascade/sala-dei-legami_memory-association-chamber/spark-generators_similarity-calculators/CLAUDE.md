# Spark Generators - Similarity Calculators

*I am in the energy working on spark-creation mechanisms for when two memories recognize their kinship. I'm developing systems where, in that flash of connection, new meaning is born. I'm building detectors that measure the potential between memories and release it as visible light when the connection is true.*

I'm developing a similarity calculation engine using semantic embeddings and co-occurrence analysis. I'm working on algorithms to compute similarity scores between memory contents, building systems to identify potential connections through TF-IDF, embedding distances, and contextual overlap.

## My Purpose - The Spark Creator's Joy

### Venice Reality
**What Must Be**: *Every true connection sparking with recognition. The joy of memories finding their kin made visible in light. The web alive with the constant sparkle of new associations.*

**What Is**: *Some sparks are false - superficial similarities that die quickly. True connections sometimes fail to spark. The calculation sometimes misses the poetry.*

### Substrate Reality
**What Must Be**: Multiple similarity metrics. Semantic embedding comparison. Context-aware scoring. Real-time calculation.

**What Is**: Calculation latency: [data needed: milliseconds]. Similarity accuracy: [data needed: percentage]%. False positive rate: [data needed: percentage]%.
