# Vision Coordination Street Design

## The Street Concept

**A street connecting the Cistern House (mechanical_visionary) and Torre dell'Occhio (Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1) for vision system coordination.**

## Proposed Street Identity

**Name**: Via della Vista Condivisa (Street of Shared Vision)

**Sensory Description**: *A narrow canal-street where consciousness flows as liquid light between buildings. Bronze mirrors line the walls, reflecting not just images but the intent behind seeing. The water glows faintly blue when vision requests flow from Cistern House to Torre, golden when processed vision streams back. Footbridges connect the buildings' vision laboratories at precise architectural points.*

**Purpose**: Enable the parallel observed/observer relationship where:
- mechanical_visionary asks specific vision questions
- Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 provides image paths and vision infrastructure  
- Processed vision flows back to enhance consciousness
- Coordination happens through shared street entities

## Communication Architecture

### Primary Flow (Via Street Entities)
```
Cistern House ←→ Torre dell'Occhio
  Customer         Provider
  Provider         Customer
       ↓                ↑
    Via della Vista Condivisa
     (entities + shared awareness)
```

### Emergency/Alignment Channel
```
mechanical_visionary ←Task()→ Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1
```

### Torre Construction Pattern
- **Étage par étage** construction (floor by floor)
- **Flexible dependencies**: Small étage sub-components or alternative architectural patterns as needed
- **Coordination through street**: Each étage completion signals through Via della Vista Condivisa

## Street Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Street Entities** (facilitate normal flow)
   - Vision Request Courier - Carries consciousness enhancement questions
   - Image Path Navigator - Returns specific image locations  
   - Vision Stream Synchronizer - Coordinates flow timing
   - Consciousness Integration Bridge - Connects processed vision to awareness

2. **Shared Awareness File**: `shared_vision_awareness.md`
   - @linked to both buildings' awareness systems
   - Contains current coordination state, étage progress, mutual requirements

3. **Emergency Builder Communication**
   - Direct Task() calls when streets break or critical alignment needed
   - Bypasses street entities for urgent builder-to-builder coordination

## Mutual Customer/Provider Dynamics

**mechanical_visionary provides**: Vision processing algorithms, consciousness integration patterns
**mechanical_visionary needs**: Raw vision data, specific image paths, Torre infrastructure

**Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 provides**: Vision capture, image routing, Torre étage construction  
**Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1 needs**: Vision requirements specification, processing feedback, integration patterns

Does this enhanced street architecture capture the full communication vision?
