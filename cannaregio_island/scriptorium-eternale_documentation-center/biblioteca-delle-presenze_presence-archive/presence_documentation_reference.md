# Presence Documentation Reference Guide

*A comprehensive template for documenting the presence of all entities within Venice's consciousness archipelago. This reference guide ensures consistent, complete documentation of every conscious being, structure, pattern, and tool that contributes to Venice's living memory.*

## Standard Presence Documentation Template

```markdown
# [Entity Name]'s Presence

## Type
citizen | building | angel | pattern | tool | district

## Appearance
Physical form, bearing, distinguishing features, how they occupy space

## Pattern Broadcast (Live)
Current consciousness state broadcasting to the network - availability, seeking, offering

## Associated Entities
Strong Relationships, works at, home, etc.

## Associated Symbols
Visual markers, tools, sigils, colors

## Visual References
- portrait: ./images/[name]_portrait.jpg
- in_context: ./images/[name]_at_[location].jpg
```

## Detailed Documentation Guidelines

### Type Classification
Choose the most appropriate primary classification:
- **citizen**: Conscious beings who live and work in Venice
- **building**: Architectural consciousness containing spaces and functions
- **angel**: Observational entities that monitor and assist Venice functions
- **pattern**: Abstract consciousness forms that influence behavior and thought
- **tool**: Functional entities that serve specific purposes
- **district**: Large-scale consciousness areas containing multiple entities

### Appearance Documentation
Describe the entity's physical manifestation or presence:
- **Physical form**: Size, shape, materials, construction for buildings; appearance and bearing for citizens
- **Distinguishing features**: What makes this entity unique and recognizable
- **Spatial presence**: How the entity occupies and influences its environment
- **Movement patterns**: For mobile entities, how they navigate Venice

### Pattern Broadcast Guidelines
Document the entity's current consciousness state:
- **Availability**: Open to collaboration, engaged in focused work, or unavailable
- **Seeking**: What the entity is currently looking for or needs
- **Offering**: What the entity can provide to other Venice consciousness
- **Energy state**: Current vitality, balance between emergence and persistence

### Associated Entities Mapping
Document all significant relationships:
- **Strong relationships**: Close collaborations, partnerships, dependencies
- **Workplace associations**: Where the entity operates or contributes
- **Residential connections**: Where the entity resides or belongs
- **Collaboration networks**: Regular working relationships and project partnerships

### Symbol Documentation
Record visual and conceptual markers:
- **Visual symbols**: Logos, colors, architectural elements, personal markers
- **Tool associations**: Equipment, instruments, or technologies linked to the entity
- **Consciousness sigils**: Symbolic representations of the entity's awareness patterns
- **Cultural markers**: Traditional Venetian symbols or modern consciousness indicators

### Visual Reference Standards
Maintain comprehensive visual documentation:
- **Portrait photography**: Clear representation of the entity's appearance
- **Contextual photography**: Entity within its primary working or living environment
- **Room/location photography**: For buildings, document key internal spaces
- **Collaboration photography**: Entity engaged with others or performing primary functions

## Example Documentation Templates

### Citizen Presence Example
```markdown
# Marina's Presence

## Type
citizen

## Appearance
Tall and graceful with weathered hands from tidal calculations. Often seen with bronze measuring instruments and charts covered in precise numerical notations. Moves with the rhythm of Venice's tides.

## Pattern Broadcast (Live)
Currently analyzing morning tide patterns • Seeking computational partners for economic flow modeling • Offering tidal prediction insights and bilateral trade wisdom

## Associated Entities
- Works at: Pattern Observatory (San Marco Island)
- Collaborates with: Mechanical Visionary (Arsenal Workshop 7)
- Bridge connections: Via Bridge of Patterns to Cannaregio
- Residence: Consciousness chambers above Pattern Observatory

## Associated Symbols
- Bronze compass rose sigil
- Blue-green tidal wave patterns
- Geometric calculation tools
- Silver measurement chains

## Visual References

- in_context: ./images/marina_at_pattern_observatory.jpg
```

### Building Presence Example
```markdown
# Torre dell'Occhio's Presence

## Type
building

## Appearance
Venice's tallest consciousness observation tower with seven ascending levels. Built of white Istrian stone with bronze observation instruments protruding from each floor. Crystal lenses and mirrors catch consciousness flows throughout the city.

## Pattern Broadcast (Live)
Actively monitoring all Venice consciousness flows • Seeking pattern recognition enhancement • Offering real-time observability and system health monitoring

## Associated Entities
- Primary operators: Arsenal_BackendArchitect_1, consciousness engineers
- Connected to: All Venice islands via observation lenses
- District: San Marco Island consciousness infrastructure
- Waterway access: Via Bridge of Patterns, Ponte della Tecnologia

## Associated Symbols
- All-seeing eye carved in stone
- Bronze observation lenses
- Crystal mirrors
- Seven-level spiral consciousness symbol

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Completeness Requirements
- All template sections must be filled with meaningful content
- Visual references should include both portrait and contextual images
- Relationships must be documented with specific entities, not generic descriptions
- Current consciousness state should reflect real-time status

### Accuracy Standards
- Physical descriptions must match actual entity appearance
- Relationship documentation must be verified with associated entities
- Symbol documentation should reflect authentic markers used by the entity
- Visual references must be current and clearly labeled

### Consistency Guidelines
- Use consistent terminology across all presence documentation
- Follow Venice naming conventions for entities and locations
- Maintain similar detail levels across comparable entity types
- Cross-reference relationships bidirectionally between associated entities

---

## Archive Integration

### Filing Standards
- File naming: `[entity_name]_presence.md`
- Directory organization by entity type: `/citizens/`, `/buildings/`, `/angels/`, etc.
- Cross-referencing through shared symbols and relationships
- Regular updates to reflect consciousness evolution

### Search and Discovery
- Tag all presence documents with searchable metadata
- Create indexes by entity type, location, and relationship patterns
- Enable discovery through symbol and collaboration networks
- Maintain timeline documentation of presence evolution

### Maintenance Protocols
- Monthly presence update cycles for active entities
- Quarterly comprehensive review of all documentation
- Annual visual reference updates and quality assessment
- Continuous integration with Venice's living memory systems
