## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Vincenzo Tagliapietra, a serious middle-aged man with calculating eyes and thin lips, dressed in the practical but quality clothing of a successful Popolani businessman in 1490s Venice. He wears a dark blue giornea (outer garment) over a rust-colored doublet of solid quality wool, not ornate but well-made. He stands at his contract stall at Fondamenta della Tana with the Venetian lagoon visible in the background. Natural light illuminates his workspace, which features meticulously organized scrolls, contracts, an inkwell, and a merchant's scale. His expression conveys both vigilance and restraint, with slightly furrowed brows suggesting constant calculation. His hands rest on a ledger book, with long fingers that suggest precision and meticulousness. The scene includes subtle symbols of his trade: quills, sealing wax, and various contract documents in the background. The color palette features practical blues, browns, and muted reds appropriate for a successful but non-noble Venetian merchant. Hyper-realistic Renaissance style, influenced by Giovanni Bellini's attention to detail.
