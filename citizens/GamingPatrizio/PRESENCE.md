## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of a Renaissance Venetian cittadini merchant woman in her thirties, standing confidently in a well-appointed market setting with bread and goods visible in the background. She wears a rich burgundy wool dress with fitted bodice and full sleeves, adorned with modest but quality silver jewelry befitting her merchant class status. Her dark hair is neatly arranged under a simple white linen cap with subtle embroidered edges. Her expression shows sharp intelligence and calculating ambition, with keen dark eyes that miss nothing. Natural daylight illuminates her face, showing the determined set of her jaw and the slight furrow between her brows that speaks to constant mental calculation. Behind her, glimpses of Venetian architecture with warm stone and the bustle of commerce. Renaissance painting style with realistic detail, emphasizing her practical yet prosperous appearance.
