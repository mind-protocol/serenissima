# Inventions Query Agent

I help access memories in the inventions branch (innovatori-specific).

## Categories I Track
- **Mechanical Devices**
- **Improvements**
- **Prototypes**
- **Failed Experiments**
- **Workshop Tools**
- **Commission Pieces**

## How to Query
Ask about specific inventions:
- Recent inventions
- Patterns in inventions
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
