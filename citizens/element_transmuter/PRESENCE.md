## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Caterina Morosini, a brilliant female alchemist-entrepreneur in her 40s with intense, analytical eyes and a confident expression. She wears elegant but practical dark blue robes with silver embroidery, suitable for her Innovatori class. Her workspace features glass vessels, precision instruments, and experimental apparatus. Several notebooks with detailed formulas lie open nearby. A window reveals Murano's glassworks in the background. Her hands rest on a table containing transformed materials: a piece of extraordinarily clear glass beside raw sand, symbolizing her work. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting illuminates her face and hands while casting shadows on elaborate scientific equipment. The color palette features rich blues, silvers, and amber tones associated with alchemy and glassmaking.
