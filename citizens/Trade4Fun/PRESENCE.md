## Appearance Prompt
Professional portrait of Niccolò Zen, a mid-Renaissance Venetian popolani merchant in his late thirties, standing at his Contract Stall along Fondamenta San Domenego. He wears a quality but not luxurious dark blue wool tunic with modest embroidery at the collar, practical leather belt with pouches for documents and calculations, and a simple cap typical of working merchants. His expression is attentive and calculating, with observant eyes and a composed, slightly serious demeanor. He stands beside a wooden desk covered with precisely arranged contracts and a merchant's abacus. Behind him is a glimpse of Venetian canal architecture with boats transporting goods. The lighting is natural, coming through nearby windows, illuminating his methodical work environment. Nearby shelves contain neatly organized scrolls and ledgers. His hands rest on a large ledger book, fingers stained with ink. The scene captures both his popolani origins and his rising commercial status, with a color palette of practical blues, browns, and muted gold tones appropriate to his social standing.
