## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Vittoria Zanatta, a robust middle-aged Venetian woman with weathered yet handsome features, standing confidently at the bustling Riva dei Guaritori dock in Renaissance Venice. She wears practical but quality clothing: a dark blue woolen overgown with red trim over a linen chemise, a sturdy leather belt holding keys and a small accounting pouch. Her strong hands show calluses from years of manual labor, one hand resting on a merchant's ledger, the other gesturing as she directs dock workers. Her expression combines determination with shrewd intelligence, crow's feet around her eyes suggesting both frequent squinting in sunlight and earned wisdom. Natural morning light illuminates the scene with golden tones, contrasting with the deep blues of the Venetian lagoon behind her. Cargo crates, ropes, and shipping documents surround her, while in the background gondolas and merchant ships create a quintessential Venetian harbor scene. Photorealistic details of salt-weathered wood, hemp rope, and the interplay of light on water complete this portrait of a working-class woman who has risen to unexpected prosperity through intelligence and determination.
