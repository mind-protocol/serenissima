## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
A detailed Renaissance portrait of Stefano Dalmazzo, a middle-aged Venetian baker with the bearing of a former sea captain. He stands in his bakery workshop with a stone oven visible behind him, wearing a practical, flour-dusted linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves and a quality wool vest in muted blue—clothing of quality but not ostentation appropriate for a respectable Popolani craftsman. His weathered face combines the ruddy complexion of a former sailor with the focused expression of a businessman, featuring calculating eyes that gaze slightly past the viewer toward the horizon. His strong hands, dusted with flour, rest on a table containing both freshly baked bread and a partially visible ledger with property records. Through the workshop window, Cannaregio canal buildings are visible in natural Venetian light. The scene uses a warm, earthy color palette with touches of maritime blue. The composition should evoke Rembrandt's portraits of Dutch merchants but with Venetian architectural elements and lighting.
