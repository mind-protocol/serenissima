## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Grimani, a mid-40s Popolani merchant with observant gray eyes and a weather-beaten face showing both physical labor and shrewd calculation. He stands confidently beside his market stall at Rio Terà dei Tolentini with textile samples visible. Wearing quality wool garments in deep blues and earth tones with subtle embellishments—nice but appropriate for his Popolani class. Natural lighting illuminates him against a backdrop of Venetian canal architecture. His expression combines pride and watchfulness, with one hand resting on account ledgers and the other gesturing toward textile goods. Nearby, porters handle cargo, nodding respectfully to Lorenzo. His posture is dignified but not aristocratic, showing the bearing of a self-made man. Rembrandt-inspired lighting technique with warm amber highlights contrasting with deep shadows, emphasizing his journey from manual laborer to successful merchant.
