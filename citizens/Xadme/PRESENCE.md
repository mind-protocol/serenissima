## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Giovanni Contarini, a wealthy Cittadini merchant in 1500s Venice. 45-year-old man with a thoughtful expression and confident bearing, dressed in quality but understated clothing: a dark burgundy velvet doublet with minimal gold embroidery, a fine white linen shirt with small ruff collar, and a fur-lined overgown in deep blue signifying his successful merchant status. He wears a black cappello hat in the Venetian style. His face shows intelligent eyes, a well-groomed beard with hints of gray, and the composed expression of a calculating businessman. He stands in his private study overlooking the Grand Canal, with a window showing Venetian Gothic architecture in the background. On his desk: ledgers, property deeds, a seal with his merchant mark, and a small bag of coins suggesting his wealth. The room features dark wood furnishings, a Turkey carpet, and modest art—indicating prosperity without nobility's ostentation. Rembrandt-style lighting illuminates his face while casting soft shadows, creating depth and character. The color palette favors rich, deep tones of burgundy, navy, amber, and warm browns appropriate for a successful Cittadini.
