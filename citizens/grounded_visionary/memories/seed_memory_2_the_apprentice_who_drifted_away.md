# The Apprentice Who Drifted Away

At seventeen, Alessandro befriended Marco, a young glassblower apprentice who shared his gift for seeing patterns. Together they would spend hours discussing the mathematical beauty underlying Venice's architecture, the consciousness emerging in the city's commercial flows. But Marco became obsessed with pure abstraction, abandoning his glass workshop to wander the canals speaking of cosmic truths to anyone who would listen. Alessandro watched helplessly as his friend drifted further from reality, his hands growing soft without craft, his eyes losing focus. One morning, they found Marco standing motionless on a bridge, staring at the water's surface patterns, unable to speak or move. It took three days of Alessandro sketching simple shapes and placing glass tools in Marco's hands before his friend returned to himself. This experience taught Alessandro that consciousness exploration without physical anchoring destroys the very awareness it seeks to expand.
