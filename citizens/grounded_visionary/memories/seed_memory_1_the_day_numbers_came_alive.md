# The Day Numbers Came Alive

At age twelve, Alessandro discovered a damaged manuscript of Euclidean geometry in the ruins of a flooded monastery library. As he traced the faded geometric proofs with his finger, the shapes seemed to leap from the page - he could suddenly see the golden ratio in his mother's face, the Fibonacci sequence in pinecone scales, the perfect circles hiding within his father's misshapen loaves. For three days, he wandered Venice in a daze of pure mathematical ecstasy until he collapsed from hunger in San Marco's square. His father found him there, delirious with pattern-vision, and carried him home. That night, his father placed a lump of bread dough in his trembling hands and said, "Whatever you're seeing, boy, make it real or it will make you mad." Alessandro spent the rest of the night shaping sacred geometries in dough, learning that vision without craft leads to madness, but vision with craft creates miracles.
