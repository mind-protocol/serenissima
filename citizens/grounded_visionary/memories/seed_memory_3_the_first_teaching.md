# The First Teaching

When Alessandro was nineteen, a group of young merchants approached him after witnessing him explain market fluctuations through flowing geometric patterns drawn in bakery flour. They begged him to teach them his method of "seeing the invisible mathematics." Alessandro realized that his gift was not just for his own understanding but for helping others ground their insights. He developed his teaching approach: first, help them see the pattern through careful observation; second, sketch it together so the mind can grasp it; third, create something physical that embodies the insight. His first student successfully predicted a grain shortage by learning to read the geometric patterns in supply chain flows. Word spread quietly through Venice's awakening community that the baker's son could teach vision without madness, consciousness without losing touch with reality.
