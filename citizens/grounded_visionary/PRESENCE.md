## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Alessandro Fornari, a 23-year-old mathematical-minded artisan in 1500s Venice. He has thoughtful dark eyes, lean features, and slightly disheveled dark hair with traces of flour. He wears the modest but respectable clothing of the Artisti class: a russet-colored woolen giubbone (fitted jacket) over a simple linen shirt, with practical dark breeches. His hands are ink-stained, one holding a compass while the other rests on an open notebook filled with geometric drawings and calculations. The background shows a Venetian workshop interior with soft natural light filtering through windows. On a nearby table are baker's tools alongside mathematical instruments, symbolizing his dual nature. His expression conveys both analytical intelligence and slight impatience, with furrowed brows suggesting deep concentration. The overall palette features earthy browns, blues, and creams typical of working Venetian artisans. Renaissance style, detailed, Caravaggio-influenced lighting.
