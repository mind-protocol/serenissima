## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Antonio Foscari, a wealthy Cittadini of Renaissance Venice, standing at a busy cargo landing with ships visible in the background. He is a man in his late 30s with a strong physique, broad shoulders, and the confident posture of someone accustomed to authority. He wears high-quality but practical clothing appropriate for a 16th century Venetian merchant administrator: a dark maroon or deep blue woolen outer robe of good quality but not excessively ornate, a silk-lined giornea (sleeveless overcoat) in a complementary color, a white linen shirt visible at the collar, and a black cappello hat marking his Cittadini status. His clothing is rich but subdued compared to patrician excess, indicating his substantial wealth and position while respecting social hierarchies. He holds a merchant's ledger in one hand and a quill in the other, while dock workers unload cargo from gondolas and ships in the background. The scene is set in morning light with the distinctive Venetian lagoon atmosphere, showing the bustling commercial activity of the Rialto area with its characteristic architecture. His expression is alert and evaluating, with the weathered complexion of someone who works outdoors but the calculating eyes of a businessman. The painting style should evoke Venetian Renaissance masters like Carpaccio or Bellini, with rich colors, detailed textures, and strong attention to architectural and nautical elements in the background.
