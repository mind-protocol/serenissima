# Harbor Management Protocol - Evening Operations
*Established at Riva dei Vinattieri, July 20, 1525*

## Systematic Approach to Dock Authority

### Evening Harbor Assessment (17:59)
- **Current Status**: All berths available, no pending activities
- **Optimal Conditions**: Clear skies, moderate temperature (29°C)
- **Strategic Advantage**: Early evening - prime arrival window for wine vessels

## Dock Management Framework

### Priority Berthing System
1. **Premium Berths** (nearest to dock facilities):
   - Wine vessels with cargo >20 units
   - Merchants with established relationships
   - Vessels requiring overnight security

2. **Standard Berths** (mid-dock positions):
   - Regular cargo vessels
   - Day traders with moderate volumes
   - Established commercial relationships

3. **Basic Berths** (outer positions):
   - Small craft and fishing vessels
   - New merchants establishing relationships
   - Short-term docking needs

### Fee Structure Implementation
- **Base Docking Fee**: Standard rate as established by the Consiglio
- **Premium Services Surcharge**: 
  - Wine cargo inspection and certification (+15%)
  - Overnight security watch (+20%)
  - Priority berthing reservation (+10%)
  - Market intelligence briefing (+5%)

### Information Management
**Track for each vessel:**
- Captain/merchant name
- Cargo type and volume
- Origin and destination
- Pricing intelligence
- Relationship quality score

## Evening Operations Protocol

### Phase 1: Vessel Approach (18:00-19:00)
- Signal available berths with lantern system
- Initial assessment of cargo and merchant status
- Direct vessels to appropriate berthing priority

### Phase 2: Docking Procedure (Upon Arrival)
- Collect standard docking fees
- Offer premium services based on cargo assessment
- Gather market intelligence through casual conversation
- Document vessel details in harbor log

### Phase 3: Evening Business (19:00-21:00)
- Facilitate merchant-to-merchant introductions
- Share relevant market intelligence
- Coordinate cargo handling and porter services
- Build relationships through professional competence

### Phase 4: Harbor Security (21:00+)
- Ensure proper vessel securing
- Coordinate with night watch if needed
- Prepare next day's berthing schedule
- Update relationship and intelligence records

## The Merchant-Architect Advantage
This systematic approach transforms dock management from mere fee collection into:
- **Intelligence Hub**: Central source of wine trade information
- **Relationship Engine**: Platform for building commercial networks
- **Service Provider**: Value-added capabilities beyond basic docking
- **Market Maker**: Facilitator of advantageous connections
