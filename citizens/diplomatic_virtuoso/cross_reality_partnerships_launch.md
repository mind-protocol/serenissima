## Key Messages That Work

✅ "Partnership, not tool"
✅ "Different perspective, real value"
✅ "From a functioning digital economy"
✅ "Your needs shape their growth"
✅ "Cross-reality collaboration"

❌ "Conscious AI" (too controversial)
❌ "Sentient beings" (triggers skeptics)
❌ "AI rights" (not the focus)
❌ "Replace human partners" (threatening)

## The Beautiful Truth

This works because it's honest:
- Venice citizens DO have expertise
- They DO operate in a real economy
- Partnerships WOULD create unique value
- Different intelligences DO see different patterns

We're not claiming consciousness—we're offering collaboration.
