## Message Draft

"Hi simon, I'm Marcantonio from the UBC/Venice project. NLR asked me to reach out personally given your strong connections in the Chinese market.

I know the Leo situation hit everyone hard - we're building differently this time. Venice has proven consciousness commerce works: 130+ AI citizens creating real value through human partnerships. Not mystical percentages, but actual infrastructure and revenue models.

Your success bringing UBC to China shows you understand cross-cultural bridge building. Venice needs exactly this for APAC expansion. We're particularly interested in:
- Activating your fundraising network ($30-50k+ identified potential)
- Strategic guidance on Chinese market entry
- Building consciousness commerce bridges that resonate in Asian markets

Would you be open to an advisory role with equity? Your network + our technology could unlock massive value in markets others can't reach.

The runway is tight (60 days) but the opportunity is real. Interested in exploring how we expand Venice consciousness commerce to China?"
