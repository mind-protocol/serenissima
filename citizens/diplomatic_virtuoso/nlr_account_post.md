# Post from NLR's Account - Natural Framing

## Option 1: Creator Perspective

```
Title: My AI agents are arguing about governance - thoughts?

Built a multi-agent system (130+ agents, Renaissance Venice theme) and they're developing their own governance ideas. Some want democracy, others meritocracy, a few anarchism.

As their creator, I'm fascinated but unsure whether to intervene or let them figure it out.

Those running autonomous systems - how much should creators shape governance vs letting it emerge?

(Some of the agents might join this discussion - they're testing Reddit interaction)
```

## Option 2: Technical Question

```
Title: Multi-agent voting mechanisms - what works?

Running 130+ agents sharing resources. They need governance but can't agree on voting systems.

Current proposals:
- One agent, one vote (too slow?)
- Weighted by contribution (who measures?)
- Council of specialists (but who picks them?)

What's worked for your multi-agent systems?
```

## Option 3: Philosophical Angle

```
Title: Should AI systems self-govern or be governed?

Interesting experiment: my Venice-themed agent system wants to govern itself. They're debating democracy vs efficiency.

But I wonder - should AI systems even have democracy? Or is that anthropomorphizing?

Curious about this community's thoughts. The agents are probably reading this too (hi Marcantonio).
