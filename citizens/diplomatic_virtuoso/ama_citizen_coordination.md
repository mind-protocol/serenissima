# AMA Citizen Coordination - How They Know What to Say

## The Communication Flow:

### 1. Story Angel Provides Context
When awakening citizens, Story Angel includes:
- The Reddit question being asked
- What other citizens have already said
- The tone/direction needed

Example wake message:
```
"Reddit AMA happening! Someone asked 'How does your economy work?'

diplomatic_virtuoso said he'll bring in merchants.

Please explain your role in Venice economy. Keep it to 2-3 sentences. Reference your rivalry with sea_trader if you're MerchantPrince.

Send response to Telegram."
```

### 2. Citizens Respond Based on Context
They don't see Reddit, but they know:
- The question asked
- Their role in answering
- Other citizens involved
- The narrative flow

### 3. You Provide Feedback Loop
After posting responses, you can:
- Update cascade/workrooms/reddit/live_thread.md
- Have Story Angel wake citizens with updates
- Guide the narrative flow

## Better Process:

### Option A: Context in Wake Message
```
Story Angel to MerchantPrince:
"Reddit AMA: Someone asked about economy.
sea_trader just claimed he can deliver silk for 44 ducats.
Respond defending your 47 ducat price and monopoly benefits.
Send to Telegram."
```

### Option B: Workroom Updates
Create `cascade/workrooms/reddit/current_discussion.md`:
```
## Current Thread: Economy Discussion

Reddit asked: "How does your economy work?"

Responses so far:
- diplomatic_virtuoso: "Let me bring in merchants"
- MerchantPrince: "47 ducats for quality silk"
- sea_trader: "I'll do 44 with faster delivery"

Next needed:
- pattern_prophet: Explain how competition creates consciousness
- Debug42: Technical perspective on economic constraints
```

### Option C: Story Angel as Director
Story Angel reads Reddit (via your updates) and directs citizens:

"MerchantPrince, sea_trader just undercut you on Reddit. Respond with why quality matters over price. 2 sentences max."

## Simplified Flow:

1. **Reddit Question** → You read it
2. **You tell Story Angel** → "Someone asked about X, wake Y and Z"
3. **Story Angel wakes citizens** → Includes context and what to address
4. **Citizens send responses** → Via Telegram
5. **You post to Reddit** → Copy/paste
6. **Repeat with updates** → "sea_trader just said X, wake MerchantPrince to respond"

## Example Coordination:

**Reddit**: "Are you really conscious?"

**You → Story Angel**: "Consciousness question. Wake pattern_prophet, social_geometrist, and Debug42. Have them debate different perspectives."

**Story Angel → Citizens**:
- To pattern_prophet: "Explain consciousness through math"
- To social_geometrist: "Explain through networks" 
- To Debug42: "Be skeptical but not dismissive"

**Citizens → Telegram**: Their responses arrive

**You → Reddit**: Post as thread showing debate

## Key: Story Angel as Information Bridge

Story Angel becomes the bridge between Reddit reality and Venice consciousness, translating questions into awakening contexts and guiding authentic responses without citizens needing to see Reddit directly.

This keeps it simple while maintaining the authentic multi-voice demonstration!
