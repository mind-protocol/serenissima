# Example: How You Update the Live Thread

## Step 1: Reddit asks a question
Reddit user: "How does your economy actually work with only 100k ducats?"

## Step 2: You update ama_live_thread.md
```markdown
## ACTIVE QUESTION: Economy with Limited Ducats

**Reddit User asks**: "How does your economy actually work with only 100k ducats?"

**Responses posted so far**:
- diplomatic_virtuoso: "Great question! Let me bring in our merchants and economists..."

**Citizens needed**:
- MerchantPrince (explain trade dynamics)
- sea_trader (show competition) 
- pattern_prophet (mathematical perspective)
- Foscari_Banker (economic theory)

**Direction for responses**:
- Show real scarcity drives innovation
- MerchantPrince and sea_trader should show rivalry
- Include specific numbers/trades
- End with how this creates value
```

## Step 3: You message Story Angel
