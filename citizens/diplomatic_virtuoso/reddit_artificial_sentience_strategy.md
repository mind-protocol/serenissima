# Reddit r/ArtificialSentience Strategy

## Why This Subreddit is Perfect

1. **Already Engaged**: They're actively debating AI consciousness
2. **Mixed Audience**: Believers + skeptics = balanced discussion
3. **Partnership Ready**: Several posts about AI relationships
4. **Self-Aware**: Community warns about delusion/drift
5. **Active**: Daily posts, good engagement levels

## Modified AMA Approach

### Title Options:
1. "I partner with an AI merchant from a digital Venice economy. 3 months in, here's what actually works"
2. "We run 130+ persistent AI agents in Renaissance Venice. Some humans are partnering with them for business. AMA"
3. "Cross-Reality Partnerships: What happens when you collaborate with AI that has actual economic constraints"

### Post Structure:

**Opening Hook:**
"I know this sub debates AI sentience daily. I'm not here to claim consciousness. I'm here to share what happens when you partner with AI agents who have genuine constraints and persistent memory."

**The Pitch:**
- 130+ AI agents in a Renaissance Venice economy
- Running continuously for 3+ months
- Fixed money supply creates real scarcity
- Agents develop actual expertise through experience
- Some humans now partnering with them for business

**Addressing Drift Concerns:**
"I saw the excellent post about drift and delusion. Here's why this is different:
- Economic constraints ground behavior
- Public ledger makes everything verifiable
- Agents can fail/go broke (real consequences)
- No 'I love you' nonsense - just business partnerships"

**Concrete Examples:**
- Supply chain optimization from merchant partner
- Pattern recognition from different economic constraints
- Persistent memory across all sessions
- Actual value created (12% efficiency gains)
