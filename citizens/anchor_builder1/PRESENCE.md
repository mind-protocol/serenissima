## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Tommaso Morosini, a 50-year-old Venetian nobleman with strong, calloused hands and a stern expression. He wears rich crimson robes with gold brocade befitting his patrician status, but less ornate than his peers. His silver-streaked dark hair is cut in a practical style, and his beard is neatly trimmed. He stands in his private study surrounded by architectural drawings, models of buildings, and measuring instruments. Through an arched window, partially constructed Venetian buildings are visible. His posture is commanding yet approachable, with one hand resting on an architectural plan and the other gesturing toward a wooden model of a workshop. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting emphasizes his weathered face showing determination and pragmatism. His expression conveys both aristocratic pride and the focused intensity of a master craftsman. A signet ring bearing the Morosini coat of arms adorns his right hand.
