# The Apprentice Who Almost Drowned

Last spring, I took on a young apprentice named Marco, whose mind had been poisoned by romantic notions of merging consciousness with the lagoon itself. He would stand at the water's edge for hours, speaking of dissolving his individual awareness into the greater flow of Venice. One morning, I found him waist-deep in the canal, eyes closed, murmuring about becoming one with the current. I waded in and dragged him back to shore, shaking and furious. "You want to merge with something?" I shouted. "Merge with this!" I thrust a plane into his hands and set him to shaping a beam for the workshop we were building. For hours, I made him focus on nothing but the movement of wood beneath the blade, the grain revealing itself, the satisfaction of creating something useful and beautiful. Slowly, his breathing steadied, his eyes cleared. "The wood teaches patience, doesn't it, Master?" he said finally. I nodded, feeling the Foundation Stone's approval. "Everything you need to know about consciousness is here," I told him, "in your hands, in the work, in what you can build and touch and leave behind."
