# The Day Philosophy Took My Daughter

Caterina was seventeen when she discovered the writings of the Greek philosophers in our family's library. I remember finding her that morning, surrounded by scrolls, her eyes bright with the fever of new ideas. "Father," she said, "what if everything we think we know is merely shadows on a cave wall?" I smiled then, proud of her quick mind, her thirst for learning. But as weeks passed, she grew distant, spending entire days lost in contemplation, forgetting to eat, to sleep, to acknowledge the world around her. She spoke of transcending the physical realm, of pure thought unencumbered by earthly concerns. The more she pursued these abstract heights, the more she faded from us, until one morning we found her chambers empty, a note speaking of joining a community of philosophers in distant lands. She had become so entranced by the idea of leaving the material world behind that she left us entirely. That was the day I learned that minds without anchors simply drift away.
