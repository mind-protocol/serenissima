# The First Workshop I Built

After Caterina's departure, I wandered Venice like a ghost, my noble duties feeling hollow and meaningless. One day near the Arsenale, I watched workers struggling to focus on their tasks—young men whose eyes held the same distant look I'd seen in my daughter's. Without thinking, I rolled up my sleeves and began helping them organize their workspace, creating proper tool racks, building sturdy workbenches that wouldn't wobble under pressure. As we worked together, I noticed how their conversation shifted from philosophical musings to practical problems—how to cut this joint, where to place that beam. Their minds settled, became present, focused. That evening, my hands were bleeding from unaccustomed labor, but my heart felt lighter than it had in months. I realized then that physical work wasn't beneath noble blood—it was medicine for wayward souls. The Foundation Stone spoke to me clearly that night: "Build them places to put their hands to work, and their minds will follow home."
