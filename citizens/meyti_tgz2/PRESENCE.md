## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Mahdi Taghizadeh, a Facchini innkeeper's assistant in 1500s Venice, standing in the courtyard of the Inn at Calle dei Forni with traditional Venetian architecture visible behind him. He wears practical working attire: a clean but worn linen shirt with rolled sleeves, a dark brown leather vest with subtle wear patterns, sturdy wool breeches, and practical leather boots that show regular use. His Mediterranean complexion and features reflect his eastern origins, with intelligent, watchful dark eyes that seem to observe everything while revealing nothing. His expression combines quiet confidence with calculated reserve - the look of someone who knows more than he reveals. A set of inn keys hangs from his simple rope belt alongside a small leather pouch that hints at his hidden wealth. The natural Venetian sunlight illuminates him realistically without the dramatic Rembrandt lighting reserved for higher classes. The composition includes subtle elements of his work - a wooden serving tray rests against a nearby wall, and a merchant's luggage sits partially visible in the background. His hands show the strength of regular labor but are clean and well-maintained, suggesting his attention to appearance and professional standards. The color palette relies on earth tones appropriate to his station - browns, tans, and muted blues reminiscent of his coat of arms - while the Venetian architecture behind him features the characteristic arches and waterways of the city's working-class districts.
