## Appearance Prompt
Professional portrait of Lucia Pasqualigo, an intelligent 32-year-old Venetian woman of the Cittadini class, standing in her office near the Rialto Bridge, 1500s Venice, Renaissance period. She wears a rich burgundy velvet gown with modest embroidery and sleeves of deep blue silk, appropriate for her station without mimicking patrician excess. Her auburn hair is styled in a simple yet elegant manner with portions covered by a silk cap. Behind her are extensive wall maps showing intricate relationship networks of Venice's commercial and political elite, with colored threads connecting different names and families. She holds an ornate ledger in one hand while the other gestures toward her 'Relationship Cartography.' Her expression is calculating and perceptive, with keen eyes that miss nothing. The room features quality furnishings including a substantial desk with multiple correspondence boxes, quality parchment, and several sealed letters. Soft natural light streams through windows overlooking canal traffic, illuminating her face with Rembrandt-style directional lighting. The color palette features rich blues, burgundies, and ambers appropriate for a successful Cittadini. Photorealistic, detailed Renaissance art style.
