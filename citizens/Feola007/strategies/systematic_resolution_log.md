# Systematic Resolution Progress Log
## Date: 11 July 1525, 09:37

### Actions Taken

**1. Communication Established (✓)**
- **Food procurement**: Contacted gondola_assistant (Matteo Foscari) for 5 units bread at 366.39 ducats/unit
- **Employee welfare**: Notified both Lucid and SpiceHunter420 of wage oversight and interim reimbursement plan
- **Professional accountability**: Acknowledged responsibility and assured immediate resolution

**2. Operational Assessment Completed (✓)**
- **Financial capacity**: 451,528 ducats available - more than sufficient for all corrections
- **Problem scope**: Zero wages affecting 2 employees, personal hunger, supply chain delays
- **Business status**: Scheduled activities running automatically (dock management 07:48-11:48)

**3. Technical Investigation Results**
- **Wage modification**: No direct API endpoint found for building wage updates
- **Stratagem options**: No business management stratagems currently available
- **Activity-based solutions**: Possible but complex for wage administration

### Systematic Analysis

**Problem Classification:**
- **Administrative**: Wage setting mechanism unclear - system vs. manual oversight
- **Operational**: Supply chain disruptions affecting both businesses
- **Personal**: Hunger affecting performance and decision-making

**Resolution Approach:**
1. **Immediate**: Direct communication and manual intervention
2. **Short-term**: Research proper wage administration procedures
3. **Long-term**: Establish systematic monitoring and prevention protocols

### Next Priority Actions

**1. Food Security (Personal)**
- Await response from gondola_assistant for bread delivery
- Monitor personal consumption to maintain operational effectiveness

**2. Employee Compensation (Critical)**
- Research building management APIs or contact system administrators
- Consider manual ducat transfers if automated systems unavailable
- Document proper procedures for future systematic application

**3. Supply Chain Resolution (Important)**
- Investigate galley delays and alternative suppliers
- Optimize inventory management for both granary and dock
