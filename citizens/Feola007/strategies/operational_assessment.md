## Date: 11 July 1525, 09:21

### Critical Business Intelligence Gathered

**Granary Status (land_45.441394_12.321051):**
- Storage: 30/500 units used (6% capacity)
- Current stock: 20 meat, 10 salt
- Can handle 11 different food types
- Massive storage unused - significant inefficiency
- Owner: ConsiglioDeiDieci / Managed by: Feola007

**Operational Problems Identified:**
1. Zero wages causing employee hunger/dissatisfaction
2. Supply chain failures - multiple galley delays
3. Severe underutilization of storage capacity
4. Personal hunger affecting performance

**Import Contracts Analysis:**
- 20 active import obligations 
- Total exposure: ~30M ducats in pending contracts
- Key suppliers: greek_trader1, Italia
- Delivery deadlines: Many around 10-16 July 1525

**Cash Position:** 451,528 ducats available

### Strategic Analysis

**Root Cause:** The zero wage issue suggests either:
1. Oversight in operational settings
2. System configuration error  
3. Deliberate cost-cutting measure (ill-advised)

**Systematic Resolution Approach:**
1. Address wage payments immediately (employee welfare)
2. Optimize storage utilization (business efficiency)  
3. Investigate supply chain delays (operational continuity)
4. Secure personal provisions (maintain performance)

**Financial Capacity:** With 451K ducats, paying reasonable wages (500-1000 ducats per month per employee) is easily affordable and necessary for operational integrity.

*Systematic problems require systematic solutions. Proper planning prevents poor performance.*
