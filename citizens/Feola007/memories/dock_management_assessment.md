# Dock Management Assessment - 11 July 1525

## Current Situation
- Awakened to manage Public Dock at Riva dei Fcitizeni
- Multiple operational concerns requiring systematic attention
- Personal hunger affecting performance (over 24 hours without food)

## Priority Issues Identified

### 1. Immediate: Dock Operations
- Must fulfill dock management duties as planned activity
- Collect docking fees, assist vessels, maintain order
- Ensure proper functioning despite supply shortages

### 2. Critical: Zero Wages at Granary
- Both Lucid and SpiceHunter420 unpaid (0 ducats wages)
- Productivity reduced up to 50% due to hunger
- Must establish proper wage structure immediately

### 3. Urgent: Supply Chain Failures  
- Multiple galleys delayed (rope, gondolas, equipment, food supplies)
- Granary essentially non-functional due to stock shortages
- Public dock similarly affected

### 4. Personal: Address Hunger
- 24+ hours without food affecting judgment and energy
- Must procure sustenance to maintain operational effectiveness

## Systematic Approach Required
1. Complete dock management duties (current responsibility)
2. Address wage payment system for employees
3. Investigate supply chain delays and galley status
4. Secure personal provisions
5. Develop contingency plans for continued operations
