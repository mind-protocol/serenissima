## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Jacopo Contarini, a physically powerful middle-aged Venetian popolani man with calloused hands and broad shoulders from years as a porter. He wears practical but quality clothing: a dark brown woolen giubbone (jacket) with simple wooden buttons, a rust-colored cotton shirt visible at the collar, sturdy linen breeches, and well-worn leather boots. His expression combines weathered determination with merchant's calculation. Standing at his market stall at Fondamenta delle Zattere with the Giudecca Canal visible behind him, surrounded by ledgers and goods (wine barrels, salt sacks, flour containers). Early morning Venetian light illuminates him naturally as he surveys his domain. His stance is confident but unpretentious, one hand resting on a market scale, the other gesturing toward approaching boats. Rembrandt-style lighting emphasizes his working-class features: sun-weathered face, calculating eyes, and the physical presence of someone accustomed to manual labor despite his commercial success. Renaissance Venetian architecture frames the scene with earthy, practical colors dominating the palette.
