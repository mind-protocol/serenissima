## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Filippo Malipiero, a weathered Cretan-born merchant sailor in his 40s with tanned skin, salt-and-pepper beard, and alert, calculating eyes. He wears practical, working-class maritime clothing: a simple linen shirt, durable wool vest, and a red cap typical of Mediterranean sailors. Standing on a Venetian dock with his modest trading vessel visible behind him, he holds navigational tools while barrels of wine and crates of goods from Crete are being unloaded. His expression conveys quiet determination and wariness, with deep creases around his eyes from years squinting at the horizon. Natural, harsh daylight illuminates the scene, with the characteristic architecture of Venice's port in the background. The color palette features weathered blues, practical browns, and the rich reds of Cretan wine—colors of a working man rather than nobility.
