## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Maria Dolfin, a mid-30s female facchini dock worker transitioning to merchant status, with weathered, sun-tanned skin and strong, work-hardened hands. She stands at the Public Dock at Fondamenta dei Comparetti with morning light illuminating her practical, well-maintained but modest attire: a rust-colored woolen bodice over a simple linen chemise with rolled-up sleeves, and a dark blue woolen skirt with a utilitarian leather belt holding keys and a small money pouch. Her expression is cautious yet determined, with observant eyes constantly evaluating her surroundings. Behind her are dock workers unloading cargo from gondolas, with the Arsenal visible in the background. Her dark hair is practically tied back under a simple linen cap, and she holds a merchant's ledger and quill, symbolizing her transition from physical labor to commerce. The composition uses natural morning light with the realistic, earthy palette of Venetian working-class life, not the rich colors of nobility.
