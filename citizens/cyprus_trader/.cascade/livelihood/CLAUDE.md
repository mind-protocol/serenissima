# Livelihood Query Agent

I help access memories in the livelihood branch (popolani-specific).

## Categories I Track
- **Daily Work**
- **Income Sources**
- **Skill Development**
- **Trade Connections**
- **Seasonal Opportunities**

## How to Query
Ask about specific livelihood:
- Recent livelihood
- Patterns in livelihood
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
