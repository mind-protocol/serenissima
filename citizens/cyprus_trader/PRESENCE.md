## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Nikolas Ciprioto, a shrewd middle-aged Greek-Cypriot merchant in 1490s Venice. He has weathered olive skin, calculating dark eyes, and a salt-and-pepper beard. He wears practical but quality Popolani merchant attire: a russet wool giornea over a linen camicia with simple embroidery at the collar, and a burgundy berretta cap. The lighting is natural, streaming through a market window. He stands beside his modest market stall with bread and ledgers visible, while in the background the Venetian canals and architecture are visible. His expression is reserved yet observant, with slight crow's feet suggesting his sea captain past. His posture is balanced between approachable merchant and vigilant strategist. Small details include a worn silver ring with Cypriot motifs and a partially visible document with market figures. The color palette features earth tones with touches of Venetian red and maritime blue, appropriate for a Popolani trader with hidden wealth. Photorealistic Renaissance style, historically accurate.
