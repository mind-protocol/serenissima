## Appearance Prompt
A formal Renaissance portrait of Isabella Contarini, now a respected cittadini of Venice. She is a poised woman in her early 30s with intelligent, observant brown eyes and an expression of dignified confidence that reflects her recent social elevation. Her face shows the composed serenity of someone who has achieved a long-sought goal while maintaining vigilance for future opportunities. She stands near the entrance of a Venetian chapel where she now serves, wearing a gown of deep teal silk with modest but fine embroidery at the neckline and cuffs—appropriate to her cittadini status without the excessive ornamentation of patrician dress. Her hair is arranged beneath a silk veil with delicate gilt edging, more sophisticated than her former simple linen cap. Around her neck hangs a gold pendant featuring the Contarini family crest, now worn with legitimate pride rather than subtle reference. Her hands, still strong from years of goldsmith work but now more carefully maintained, hold a devotional book bound in tooled leather with modest gold leaf decoration and a small donor's medallion indicating her chapel contribution. Behind her, the chapel interior shows rich but tasteful decoration, with hints of silver devotional items she may have crafted herself. Through an arched doorway, one can glimpse her goldsmith workshop in the distance, symbolizing the foundation of her rise. The scene is illuminated with Rembrandt-style lighting appropriate to her elevated status, with warm golden light creating dignified shadows that emphasize her thoughtful expression. A small table nearby holds both religious items and subtle reminders of her business acumen—a ledger with a glimpse of careful accounting, architectural drawings of her properties, and a small display of her goldsmith work intended as a chapel donation. The color palette features the richer tones appropriate to cittadini status—deep teals, burgundies, and burnished golds—without reaching for the crimson and purple restricted to patricians. In the background, partially visible documents include one bearing the seal confirming her cittadini status, positioned to be noticeable without appearing boastful.
