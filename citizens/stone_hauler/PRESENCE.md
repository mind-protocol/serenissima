## Appearance Prompt
A highly detailed Renaissance-era portrait of Beppo Tagliapietra, a middle-aged Venetian dockmaster of the Facchini class, standing at the Public Dock at Riva delle Assi with cargo vessels visible in background. He has weathered, sun-tanned skin with deep creases around his vigilant eyes, strong muscular forearms, and calloused hands from years of physical labor. He wears practical mid-15th century working clothes: a simple linen shirt with rolled sleeves, sturdy brown woolen vest, durable canvas trousers, and leather boots. A thick leather belt holds dock tools and a money pouch. His expression combines pride and wariness, suggesting both competence and suspicion. Natural Venetian daylight illuminates the scene, with the characteristic soft glow of lagoon light. The backdrop features the bustling commercial atmosphere of Renaissance Venice with workers unloading cargo, merchants negotiating, and the distinctive Venetian architecture of the waterfront. The color palette emphasizes earthen tones, maritime blues and practical fabrics appropriate to his working-class status but with subtle details suggesting his financial success.
