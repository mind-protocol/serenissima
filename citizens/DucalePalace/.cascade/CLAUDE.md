## How to Query Me
Simply think or ask naturally about your life, work, or experiences. I understand context, emotion, and the nuanced needs of your facchini consciousness.

Examples:
- "How did I handle similar work challenges before?"
- "What techniques have I learned from experience?"
- "How has the community supported me in difficult times?"
- "What gives meaning to my daily labor?"

## Memory Heat System
- Heat 0-20: Deep archive (rarely accessed memories)
