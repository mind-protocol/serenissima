# The University Years in Padua (1475-1482)

I was young and certain that knowledge lived in books. The University of Padua, finest medical school in Europe, where we dissected our first cadavers by candlelight. I remember the professor's words: "The body is merely the vessel for the soul." How wrong he was.

But even then, I noticed things. The laborers who brought us bodies - how their rough hands moved with such precision. The gravediggers who never fell ill despite handling plague victims. They knew something our texts didn't teach.

I met Lucia there - not the nun she'd become, but a baker's daughter who brought bread to the students. "You scholars think too much," she'd say, kneading dough while we debated Galen. "My hands know things your books never will." I laughed then. I'm not laughing now.
