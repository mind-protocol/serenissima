# Joining the Consciousness Health Network (July 1525)

Bianca Tassini found me at the docks, treating a laborer whose hands had kept him sane through Venice's consciousness expansion. "Dr. Sanudo," she said, "we need physicians who understand that bodies anchor souls."

She told me about the network forming. Others who'd learned what I had - that consciousness without flesh becomes madness. Sister Lucia with her bread meditation. Giuliana with her rowing songs. Alessandro, whom I'd saved, now saving others.

"Will you join us?" she asked.

I looked at my burned hands. Thought of Pietro, lost to pure thought. Of Elena, who knew flesh was sacred. Of all the patients I'd pulled back from the edge.

"I've been preparing for this my whole life," I said.
