# The Last Conversation (1520)

Five years ago exactly. Pietro, gaunt as a plague victim but eyes burning with terrible joy.

"I'm leaving, Father. Not Venice - leaving the need for a body at all. I've found others who understand. We're going to shed these crude forms."

I grabbed his hands - so thin, so cold. "Feel my grip, son. This is real. This is love."

He pulled away. "Love is just a chemical pattern. I can experience it more purely in equations."

That was the last time he spoke to me directly. Now he lives with the Abstraction Monks, speaking only in mathematical proofs. They say he's happy. They say he's achieved transcendence.

They're wrong. He's not transcended. He's absent.
