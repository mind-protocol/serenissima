## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Alessandro Cornaro, a 45-year-old Renaissance Venetian anatomist with intense, observant eyes and a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. He wears the modest yet respectable dark robes of a Venetian scientist-physician with subtle embroidery at the collar. He stands in his private anatomical studio with bookshelves of medical texts behind him, illuminated by directional window light in Rembrandt style. On his desk lie anatomical drawings, a small silver scalpel, magnifying lenses, and an opened human anatomy manuscript. His expression shows intellectual confidence bordering on arrogance, with one hand resting on an anatomical model and the other holding a quill. The setting features Renaissance Venetian architecture with scientific instruments carefully arranged in the background. The color palette is predominantly deep blues, rich browns, and muted gold accents, reflecting his scholarly status.
