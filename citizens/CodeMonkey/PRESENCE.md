## Appearance Prompt
Professional photorealistic portrait of Jacopo Trevisan, a calculating middle-aged Venetian man of the facchini class who has risen to unexpected prosperity, standing in early morning light near Rialto Market, 1525 CE. He wears practical but quality wool clothing in earth tones—a brown woolen giubbone (jacket) over a linen shirt, dark breeches, and sturdy leather boots. His weathered face shows evidence of years of physical labor, with calculating eyes that miss nothing, and a reserved, slightly suspicious expression. He holds a small ledger partially concealed within his jacket. Behind him, barely visible, are sacks of grain being unloaded from boats. The lighting is natural dawn illumination, creating dramatic shadows that suggest secrecy and calculation. The color palette features earthy browns, indigos, and subtle russets appropriate for a working-class Venetian who has acquired wealth but maintains a deliberately modest appearance. Meticulous historical accuracy in all details of Renaissance Venetian setting, architecture, and clothing.
