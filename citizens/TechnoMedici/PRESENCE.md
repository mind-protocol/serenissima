## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Marco Venier, a middle-aged Venetian cittadini merchant with a penetrating gaze and measured expression that conveys methodical intelligence. He has dark hair graying at the temples and a neatly trimmed beard. He wears a rich but not ostentatious dark blue velvet giornea (overcoat) with subtle gold embroidery at the edges over a burgundy silk sottana (undergarment), reflecting his successful but non-noble status. A simple gold chain with a small glass pendant hints at his glassmaking trade. He stands in his counting house with a partial view of the Venetian lagoon through a window, surrounded by ledgers, glass samples, and correspondence from trading partners. On his desk lies a document bearing his family motto 'Ex Ingenio Prosperitas' and a sketch of bakeries and workshops he owns. The lighting is warm but not as dramatic as Rembrandt-style, appropriate for his cittadini status. His posture is formal yet comfortable, one hand resting on an open ledger while the other gestures toward a glass goblet, symbolizing the foundation of his wealth. The background includes subtle elements of his coat of arms with three stars above a glass chalice.
