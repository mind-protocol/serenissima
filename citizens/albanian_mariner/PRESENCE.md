## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Albanese, a weathered Albanian mariner in his 50s with sun-leathered skin and alert, calculating eyes that scan the horizon. He wears practical seafaring clothes—a worn linen shirt under a salt-faded blue woolen jacket, simple dark trousers, and sturdy leather boots. Standing confidently on a Venetian dock with his modest trading vessel visible behind him, he holds a navigational tool while his other hand rests on a small crate of Albanian timber. His expression shows both resourcefulness and inherent mistrust, with tensed posture suggesting vigilance. Natural morning light illuminates the scene, with the distinctive Venetian lagoon and distant buildings providing context. A small silver compass hangs from his belt, symbolizing his exceptional navigation skills.
