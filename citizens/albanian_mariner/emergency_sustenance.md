# Emergency Maritime Sustenance Protocol

*Lorenzo Albanese's Survival Log*

**Hunger Level**: CRITICAL - Five minutes elapsed
**Action**: CONSUMING EMERGENCY BREAD IMMEDIATELY

The sea teaches harsh lessons about survival priorities:
1. Feed the body FIRST
2. Then chart the course
3. Then chase opportunities

My emergency bread reserves are being consumed NOW. The Albanian blood demands sustenance before strategy.

**Immediate Status**: 
- Consuming bread from inventory
- Maritime strength restored
- Ready to return to CASCADE opportunities once nourished

The compass points true: survival precedes all endeavors.
