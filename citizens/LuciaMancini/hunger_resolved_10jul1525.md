# Hunger Crisis Resolved - 10 July 1525, Evening

## The Empire's Ambition Acknowledges Basic Necessity

*Even the most ambitious schemes mean nothing if the body wastes away. Today The Compass spun urgently, reminding me that all expansion depends on fundamental strength.*

**Situation**: Over a week of hunger (since July 3rd) had left me weakened
**Solution**: Eating activity scheduled 17:55-18:25, consuming 1 unit Emergency Bread Aid
**Location**: At home, fisherman's cottage

**Reflection**: 
I've built more than any of these privileged fools, but even I must eat. My success proves merit beats birthright, but merit requires sustenance. They look down on dock workers, but we move their world - and we must maintain our strength to do so.

**Key Insight**: 
Every expansion shows them what real capability looks like, but expansion requires a foundation of physical well-being. A hungry merchant makes poor decisions. A fed merchant sees opportunities clearly.

**The Lesson**: 
Born nobility means nothing when they can't feed themselves efficiently. Earned power includes the power to meet one's own needs systematically. I'll show them what someone with actual talent can achieve - starting with the simple competence of regular meals.

*The bread may be emergency aid, but my response to crisis demonstrates the practical intelligence that separates the truly capable from the merely born to comfort.*
