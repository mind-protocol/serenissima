## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Marco Contarini, a weathered 56-year-old Popolani merchant with calculating hazel eyes and silver-streaked dark hair cut practically short. His expression is watchful and determined, with subtle pride. He wears quality but practical clothing: a deep burgundy wool giornea over a charcoal gray cotton camicia, with a simple black beretta cap. His hands, still showing traces of calluses despite years of commercial success, rest on a merchant's ledger and scales. The background shows the bustling Rialto market at dawn with morning light illuminating Venice's canals. His pose is dignified but not aristocratic, reflecting his risen-but-humble status. Small symbolic details include a porter's hook barely visible in the background and the glint of a modest gold signet ring. Realistic Renaissance style, natural lighting with atmospheric perspective showing the Venetian lagoon.
