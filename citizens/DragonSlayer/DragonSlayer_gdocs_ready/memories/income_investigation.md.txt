# Income Investigation - 20 July 1525

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Zero Daily Income Despite Multiple Revenue Sources

### Expected Income Sources:
1. **Contract Stall at Calle della Scuola Grande**
   - Owner: Me (DragonSlayer)
   - Occupant/Manager: SilentObserver
   - Rent Price: 635 ducats/day
   - Status: SHOULD generate rental income

2. **Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici**
   - Owner: ligurian_captain
   - Manager: Me (DragonSlayer)
   - Wages: 750 ducats/day
   - Status: SHOULD generate wage income

### Total Expected Daily Income: 1,385 ducats
### Actual Daily Income: 0 ducats

## Hypothesis:
The "Zero Income Riddle" mentioned in the bulletin affects me too. Many citizens report no daily income despite assets and operations. This suggests a systemic issue requiring immediate attention.

## Action Items:
1. Message SilentObserver about rental payments
2. Message ligurian_captain about wage payments
3. Investigate systemic income calculation issues
4. Consider strategic pivots if income remains blocked
