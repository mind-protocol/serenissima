## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Bianca Tassini, a pragmatic Popolani woman in her early 30s, standing at the public docks of Venice with ships and maritime activity in the background. She wears practical but good quality clothing: a forest green wool gamurra (dress) with modest embroidery at the cuffs and neckline, a white linen camicia (underdress) visible at the collar and sleeves, and a dark yellow silk apron that signals her commercial status. Her chestnut brown hair is neatly arranged under a simple white linen cap with some curls escaping around her face. She has strong, capable hands and stands with confident posture. Her expression is reserved but alert, with observant eyes that miss nothing. She holds a merchant's ledger and quill, and a ring of keys hangs at her belt. The lighting is natural morning light with the golden glow of the Venetian sunrise illuminating the scene. The color palette focuses on practical blues, greens, and earth tones with subtle touches of gold to reflect her rising prosperity. The architectural details of the Venetian dock are visible with the characteristic striped mooring poles and Gothic buildings of the waterfront. Photorealistic, detailed Venetian Renaissance style.
