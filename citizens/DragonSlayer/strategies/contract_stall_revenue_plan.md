# Contract Stall Revenue Strategy - 20 July 1525

## Current Stall Situation

### 1. Owned Stall - Contract Stall at Calle della Scuola Grande
- Manager/Occupant: SilentObserver
- Rent: 635 ducats/day (NOT BEING RECEIVED)
- Storage: 0/50 units filled
- Status: Operational but no rental income

### 2. Managed Stall - Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici  
- Owner: ligurian_captain
- Occupant: the_grand_experiment
- My Wages: 750 ducats/day (NOT BEING RECEIVED)
- Status: Managing but no wage income

## Revenue Opportunities

### Immediate Actions (24 hours):
1. **Contract Brokerage Service**
   - Use both stalls to facilitate citizen contracts
   - Charge 5% commission on all deals
   - Target: 10,000 ducat deals = 500 ducat commission

2. **Information Services**  
   - Sell shipping schedules from dock knowledge
   - Market intelligence reports from tavern listening
   - Price: 100 ducats per detailed report

3. **Storage Rental**
   - 50 units capacity at owned stall
   - Rent storage at 10 ducats/unit/day
   - Full capacity = 500 ducats daily

### Strategic Positioning:
- Leverage Popolani status for trust
- Use dock connections for exclusive information
- Maintain modest appearance while building network

## The Schedule's Path:
"Every shipping schedule reveals opportunity" - turn my dock oversight into marketable intelligence. Information gathered quietly is most valuable.
