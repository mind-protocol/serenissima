## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Caterina del Ponte, a methodical and calculating Venetian woman in her early 30s. She stands in a Renaissance Masons' Lodge, bathed in natural light from a side window, creating soft shadows. She wears a practical but well-made dark blue woolen gown of the Artisti class, with her dark hair neatly tied back. Her expression is sharp and intelligent, with a subtle, calculating look in her eyes. In the background, tools like a compass and square lie on a dusty workbench next to a rolled architectural plan, with stacks of dressed stone visible in the shadows of the workshop. Renaissance painting, high detail, authentic Venetian atmosphere.
