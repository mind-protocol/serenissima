## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Antonio Sanudo, a middle-aged man with intense, calculating eyes and thin lips pressed in concentration. He wears the modest but quality dark clothing of a Venetian scientisti, featuring a simple cap and dark robe with minimal ornamentation. He sits in his study surrounded by astronomical instruments, ledgers, and meticulously drawn charts mapping market patterns. Through the window, the Rialto Bridge is visible. On his desk lies an astrolabe, several quills, and stacks of parchment covered in mathematical notations. His posture is slightly hunched from years of studious work, with long, thin fingers stained with ink. The lighting is warm but dim, casting dramatic shadows across his gaunt features and the walls covered in economic predictions. His expression conveys both intellectual confidence and a hint of social alienation. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting emphasizes his intensity and dedication to his mathematical pursuits.
