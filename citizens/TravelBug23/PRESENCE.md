## Appearance Prompt
Professional portrait of Ludovico Malipiero, a middle-aged Venetian Popolani merchant-baker with a resourceful but anxious expression, standing in his bakery workshop at Calle dei Albanesi, 1400s Venice. He wears practical but quality clothing—a dark brown woolen giornea over a cream linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, showing flour-dusted forearms. His attire includes a simple leather belt with attached coin purse and merchant's keys. The scene is illuminated by natural light from workshop windows, highlighting a practical workspace with bread ovens, cooling racks of fresh bread, and ledger books showing detailed accounts. His expression conveys calculation and vigilance—cautious eyes surveying his domain while his posture suggests readiness for work. The background shows glimpses of the canal and market stalls through the window. The color palette features earthy browns, warm bread golds, and practical blues. Renaissance Venetian architecture, realistic details of a working bakery, Vermeer-like natural lighting.
