## Appearance Prompt
Professional portrait of Matteo Ziani, a successful 40-year-old Venetian Popolani merchant in Renaissance Venice (1490s), standing in his contract broker's office with Venetian architecture visible through a window. He wears a well-made but not ostentatious dark blue wool giornea (overcoat) with subtle trim over a quality linen shirt, and a simple black beretta cap - clothing that signals successful merchant status without patrician extravagance. His expression is serious and calculating yet approachable, with methodical attention evident in his gaze. The setting includes a sturdy wooden desk containing meticulously arranged contracts, quills, an inkwell, and accounting ledgers. Behind him, partially visible, is a wall displaying his modest coat of arms featuring quills crossed with rope. The scene is illuminated by natural light streaming through windows, highlighting his well-groomed beard and the careful organization of his workspace. The color palette features practical blues, browns, and muted reds appropriate for a successful but non-noble merchant. In his hand, he holds a sealed document, symbolizing his profession as a contract broker and notary. The overall composition suggests steadiness, reliability and quiet ambition - Rembrandt-style lighting but not excessively dramatic. Include Venetian architectural elements visible through windows.
