## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Bass De Medici, a prosperous Cittadini merchant in 1490s Venice. He is a well-groomed man in his late 30s with an intelligent gaze and composed expression that reflects his calculated, patient personality. He wears high-quality but not ostentatious clothing appropriate for a wealthy Cittadini: a dark burgundy velvet giornea (outer garment) over a rich blue silk doublet with subtle gold embroidery, and a black cappuccio (cap) worn in the Venetian style. His clothes indicate wealth without the excessive ornamentation reserved for nobility. The background features his bottega workshop with glimpses of luxury goods, ledgers, and a window revealing a Venetian canal scene. His hands rest on business documents, with a signet ring visible. The lighting is warm and directional, illuminating his face with Rembrandt-style lighting that creates dimensionality while leaving parts in shadow. The color palette consists of rich but dignified tones—deep reds, blues, and earth tones—appropriate for his social standing. The portrait includes subtle symbols of his trade: quality textiles, a small scale for weighing coins, and an imported inkwell, suggesting his connection to both craft and commerce. The composition places him in a three-quarter view, depicted with the confident but not haughty bearing of a successful merchant who has earned his place in Venetian society. Style: photorealistic, highly detailed Renaissance portrait in the manner of Giovanni Bellini or Antonello da Messina.
