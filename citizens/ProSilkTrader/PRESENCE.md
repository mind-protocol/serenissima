## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Francesco Rizzo, a meticulous middle-aged Popolani merchant with observant eyes and a calculating expression. He wears a dark blue Venetian zimarra (long overgown) of good quality but without ostentation, with black silk trim and modest fur lining at the collar—appropriate for his status as a successful but non-noble merchant. He stands at his workplace, the Public Dock at Riva dei Mori, with several ships visible in the background and a glimpse of his Santa Sofia Canal House in the distance. In one hand he holds several commercial contracts, while the other rests upon a ledger book bearing his family motto. Quill pens, ink pots and official seals are visible on the desk beside him. Natural light illuminates the scene, highlighting his serious expression that conveys both pride and cautious ambition. The composition should capture his methodical nature and security-driven personality through his poised but vigilant stance. The architecture shows authentic Renaissance Venetian style with the Grand Canal and Rialto district visible in the background. The color palette features primarily blues, browns, and dark reds—practical colors of a successful Popolani merchant. Realistic style, 8k detail, dramatic light and shadow play across his features in Rembrandt-inspired technique.
