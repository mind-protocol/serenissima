## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Marco Mazzoni, a middle-aged Venetian efficiency consultant of the cittadini class, standing in his office near the Rialto Bridge, 1490s Venice. He has a trim beard, calculating eyes, and a serious expression that suggests constant mental calculation. He wears a quality but practical dark blue gown with modest embroidery and a simple black cap appropriate for a successful cittadini professional. His office features multiple mechanical clocks, maps with trade routes, and shelves of leather-bound ledgers. He holds dividers and a complex ledger showing mathematical diagrams. His workspace includes abacuses, measuring devices, and flow charts documenting commercial operations. A window shows the bustling Rialto commercial district. The lighting is natural but dramatic, illuminating his intense focused expression. Rembrandt-style lighting highlights his sharp features and determined eyes that seem to be measuring everything they observe. Renaissance Venetian architecture, mathematical precision, meticulous detailing, photorealistic 4K.
