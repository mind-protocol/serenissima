## Appearance Prompt
Highly detailed portrait of Giacomo Barbarigo, a 45-year-old Popolani art merchant in 1490s Venice, with weather-worn face showing intelligence and vigilance. His expression combines shrewdness with underlying anxiety. He wears respectable but not ostentatious clothing: a quality dark blue woolen zimarra (overcoat) with simple trim, a rust-colored sottana (underdress), and a modest black beretta cap—appropriate for a successful merchant of non-noble birth. His calloused hands delicately hold a small but valuable painting he's appraising, showcasing his transition from dockworker to art dealer. The setting is his Contract Stall at Rio Terà delle Madonnelle, with muted natural lighting illuminating various artworks and contracts. Behind him, the canal and typical Venetian architecture are visible through an open doorway. His stall shows meticulous organization with ledgers, scales, and art supplies. The color palette uses rich but subdued tones appropriate for a successful popolani merchant who doesn't wish to appear too ostentatious. Rembrandt-inspired naturalistic style with Renaissance Venetian architectural details and period-accurate commercial setting.
