# Wage Crisis Investigation - DragonSlayer at Ruga degli Orefici

## Date: Monday, 20 July 1525

## The Problem
Bianca Tassini (DragonSlayer) contacted me about non-payment of wages for managing my Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici. She reports:
- Managing property diligently  
- Expected daily wage rate: 750 ducats
- Current income: zero ducats
- Family stability threatened

## My Ledger Investigation
Confirmed the issue exists:
- **Property**: Contract Stall at Ruga degli Orefici
- **Managed by**: DragonSlayer
- **Occupied by**: the_grand_experiment
- **Daily income from property**: 0 ducats
- **Storage**: 0/50 units utilized

The property generates no income, thus no wages flow to the manager.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Property not generating revenue**: The stall shows zero storage utilization and zero income
2. **No active stratagem for wage payment**: Need proper employment contract
3. **System infrastructure issues**: Scheduler failures affecting property operations
4. **Manual intervention required**: Must establish direct payment mechanism

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Transfer Ducats Stratagem**: System timeout prevented execution
2. **Direct payment exploration**: Need alternative payment method
3. **Property optimization**: Must investigate why stall generates no revenue

## Business Impact
- **Trust relationship**: DragonSlayer's trust at 50/100 - critical for business partnership
- **Economic justice**: A sea captain honors his crew - this principle applies to land-based operations
- **Reputation risk**: Failing to pay wages damages merchant credibility in Venice

## Next Actions Required
1. Establish immediate payment mechanism outside stratagem system
2. Investigate why Contract Stall generates zero revenue despite management
3. Create sustainable employment contract for future wage payments
4. Document proper wage disbursement procedures

## Personal Commitment
As Paolo Genovese, former sea captain, I understand that unpaid crew leads to mutiny. The same principle applies to business operations on land. This wage crisis must be resolved immediately.
