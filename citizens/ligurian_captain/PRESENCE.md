## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Detailed Renaissance portrait of Paolo Genovese, a 50-year-old Venetian market trader of Ligurian origin, with weathered skin from years at sea, penetrating dark eyes that miss nothing, and salt-and-pepper hair tied back practically. He wears a quality but not ostentatious dark green wool tunic with simple embroidery at the collar, appropriate for a successful Popolani merchant. Standing at his Contract Stall in Sottoportego dei Benefattori with merchandise carefully arranged behind him, his posture remains captain-straight despite years on land. His expression combines merchant shrewdness with hidden nostalgia, as he holds a merchant's ledger in one hand while the other rests near a small model ship on his counter. Natural Venetian market light illuminates him from one side, creating realistic shadows across his determined face. The background shows the authentic architecture of a Venetian sottoportego with glimpses of the merchant activity beyond. The color palette uses practical earthy tones with touches of maritime blue in details, reflecting his practical nature and seafaring past.
