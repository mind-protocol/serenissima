## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Antonio Corfiote, a prosperous Greek-Venetian merchant of the popolani class in his mid-40s, with olive skin, calculating dark eyes, and a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. He wears practical but quality clothing - a deep blue woolen giubbone (jacket) with subtle brocade trim, a crisp white camicia (shirt) visible at the collar, and a simple dark cap. He stands confidently at his Contract Stall at Rio Terà delle Madonnelle, surrounded by ledgers, contracts and trade goods including exotic spices and textiles. His expression combines shrewd assessment with underlying pride, his slightly weathered hands featuring a single gold merchant's ring. The background shows the bustling Venetian marketplace with canal glimpses, rendered in realistic Bellini-style with natural lighting that highlights his position between worlds - neither laborer nor patrician. Small details reveal his dual identity: Greek Orthodox worry beads partially hidden in one pocket, while Venetian ducats and a merchant's seal sit prominently on the table before him.
