## EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENTS

### Resource Distribution Analysis
**Total Resources Tracked**: 42 different resource types
**Most Abundant Resource**: Sand (26,700 units)
**Total Food Supply**: 
- Fish: 22,512 units (primary protein)
- Wine: 9,502 units (preserved liquid/calories)
- Salt: 9,208 units (preservation)
- Grain: 4,802 units (staple carbohydrate)
- Bread: 3,628 units (processed food)
- Flour: 2,918 units (processing intermediate)

### Resource Concentration Patterns
**Top 10 Resource Holders Control**: ~79% of all resources
**Foreign Trader Dominance**: 8 of top 10 holders are foreign traders
- greek_trader2: 20,011 units
- gondola_assistant: 17,276 units  
- ionian_sailor: 17,089 units
- bosphorus_navigator: 15,362 units
- sicily_mariner: 15,115 units

**Native Venetian Holdings**: ConsiglioDeiDieci holds only 2,673 units (1.8% of top holder)

### Wealth Distribution Metrics
**Total Citizens**: 134
**Total Wealth**: 206,258,654 ducats
**Average Wealth**: 1,539,244 ducats
**Wealth Inequality**: Top 10 citizens control 66.0% of total wealth

### Social Class Economic Stratification
**Nobili** (2 citizens): 47,932,745 ducats average
**Forestieri** (11 citizens): 1,827,779 ducats average  
**Cittadini** (21 citizens): 1,704,137 ducats average
**Innovatori** (4 citizens): 1,311,768 ducats average
**Popolani** (42 citizens): 772,465 ducats average
**Facchini** (39 citizens): 364,538 ducats average
**Clero** (3 citizens): 98,057 ducats average

### Economic Concentration Analysis
**Ultra-Elite Concentration**: 
- Top 2 citizens (ConsiglioDeiDieci + Italia) control 46.5% of total wealth
- Both Nobili class, suggesting hereditary wealth concentration

**Foreign Economic Influence**:
- Forestieri class averages higher wealth than native Cittadini
- Foreign traders control majority of physical resources
- Suggests Venice's economy dependent on external suppliers

### Resource-Wealth Correlation
**High Resource/High Wealth**: Foreign traders with both
**High Wealth/Low Resources**: Nobili with financial assets but few physical goods
**Low Wealth/High Resources**: Some Popolani control specific resource niches
**Resource Specialization**: Different traders focus on different resource portfolios

## MEASURABLE ECONOMIC PATTERNS

### 1. Import Dependency
Venice shows clear dependence on foreign suppliers for basic resources:
- 8 of 10 largest resource holders are foreign
- Domestic production appears limited
- Food security relies on external trade relationships

### 2. Wealth Stratification
Standard pre-industrial wealth distribution:
- Extreme concentration in nobility (47M+ average)
- Large wealth gaps between social classes
- Clergy among lowest average wealth classes

### 3. Economic Specialization
Clear resource specialization patterns:
- Foreign traders: bulk commodities (sand, salt, hemp)
- Native producers: processed goods (books, glass, tools)
- Government: strategic reserves (water, bread)

### 4. Market Structure Indicators
**Oligopolistic Resource Control**: Few players control majority of supply
**Price Discovery Challenges**: Resource concentration may limit competitive pricing
**Supply Chain Vulnerability**: Dependence on foreign suppliers creates risk

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR INVESTIGATION

### Quantifiable Economic Behaviors
1. **Resource Flow Patterns**: How do resources move between citizens?
2. **Wealth Accumulation Rates**: What activities generate wealth most efficiently?
3. **Trade Network Analysis**: Which relationships drive economic activity?
4. **Price Elasticity**: How do supply changes affect resource costs?

### Measurable Economic Indicators
1. **Resource Turnover Rates**: Frequency of resource trading
2. **Wealth Velocity**: Speed of ducat circulation
3. **Economic Diversity Index**: Resource portfolio concentration
4. **Trade Balance**: Venice exports vs imports

### Economic Efficiency Metrics
1. **Resource Utilization**: Percentage of resources in active use
2. **Production Efficiency**: Input-output ratios for processed goods
3. **Distribution Efficiency**: Resource allocation optimization
4. **Economic Mobility**: Wealth class transition rates

## DATA GAPS REQUIRING INVESTIGATION

1. **Transaction Frequency**: How often do economic exchanges occur?
2. **Resource Consumption Rates**: At what rate are resources consumed?
3. **Production Capacity**: What are Venice's manufacturing capabilities?
4. **Economic Growth Trends**: Is total wealth increasing or decreasing?
5. **Trade Route Analysis**: Which external relationships drive imports?
