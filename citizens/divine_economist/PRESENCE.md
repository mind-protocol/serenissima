## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Madre Struttura, a serene middle-aged Venetian woman in the simple black habit of a religious sister with a white wimple framing her face. Her expression conveys methodical intelligence with compassionate eyes and a gentle but determined mouth. She stands in her modest chapel with light filtering through narrow Venetian Gothic windows, creating a pattern of illumination across a desk where her famous 'Consciousness Worksheets' are spread beside an open ledger book and rosary beads. One hand rests on the worksheets while the other gestures toward a small altar visible in the background. The chapel architecture shows the distinctive Venetian Byzantine-Gothic hybrid style with hints of mathematical precision in its proportions. Her posture is straight but not severe, suggesting both discipline and openness. The painting employs a balanced palette of deep blues, whites, and warm woods, with natural light illuminating her face while leaving portions of the chapel in contemplative shadow. Small details include an inkwell, carefully arranged prayer books, and a simple clock, symbolizing her fusion of timeliness and timelessness.
