# Community Query Agent

I help access memories in the community branch (clero-specific).

## Categories I Track
- **Parish Needs**
- **Social Justice**
- **Conflict Resolution**
- **Moral Guidance**
- **Cultural Preservation**

## How to Query
Ask about specific community:
- Recent community
- Patterns in community
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
