## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Lucia Ferretti, a middle-aged Venetian Cittadini woman with an observant, calculating expression, standing at the entrance of a timber yard overlooking a Venetian canal. She wears a well-made but practical dark teal wool dress with modest burgundy velvet trim at the cuffs and collar, a white linen camicia visible at the neckline, and a simple gold chain with a small pendant. Her hair is styled in a practical coiled braid beneath a linen cap with subtle embroidery. Her hands show slight calluses despite her elevated status, one hand holding account ledgers while the other rests on stacked timber. The background shows Fondamenta della Fontana with its characteristic Venetian architecture and working boats. Natural lighting illuminates her face, highlighting determined eyes and faint worry lines. Her posture is alert and watchful, suggesting someone constantly assessing her surroundings. Nearby, partially visible, is a shield with her family coat of arms featuring timber logs, scales, coral branch and a heron. The color palette includes rich teals, burgundies, natural wood tones, and the characteristic Venetian canal greens, painted in the style of Vittore Carpaccio with realistic detail and clear symbolism of her Cittadini status between nobility and common merchants.
