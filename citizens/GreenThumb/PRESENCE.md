## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Paola Cimenti, a Renaissance Venetian facchini woman in her 30s working as an apothecary. She wears a practical, modest dress in earth tones with a simple linen apron stained with herbal residue. Her dark hair is neatly tied back under a simple white coif. Her expression shows quiet confidence and calculated observation. She stands in her small apothecary workshop with shelves of glass jars containing herbs and remedies. Visible through a small window is a glimpse of Venice's working-class district. On her worktable are mortar and pestle, dried herbs, and a ledger showing financial calculations. Natural daylight illuminates the scene. Her posture is practical but dignified, suggesting someone who has risen through competence rather than privilege. Realistic Renaissance style, with attention to period-accurate details of a working apothecary.
