## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Marco Bianchi, a middle-aged Venetian merchant of the Popolani class in Renaissance Venice, standing at his market stall with warehouses visible in the background. He wears a well-made but practical dark brown giornea over a quality rust-colored gamurra, with a simple cap of quality wool rather than the elaborate headwear of nobility. His expression is thoughtful and calculating, with intelligent eyes that miss nothing and slightly furrowed brow suggesting his methodical nature. His hands rest on a merchant's ledger, showing ink-stained fingers from regular accounting work. The lighting is natural, streaming through a market arcade, illuminating his determined face while casting practical shadows. Nearby are symbols of his trade: scales, contract scrolls, and a small display of goods from his various enterprises. The background shows the bustling commercial district of Renaissance Venice with its characteristic architecture.
