## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Giacomo Falier, a middle-aged warehouse keeper with alert, calculating eyes and weather-lined face standing inside a Small Warehouse at Calle del Chiostro. He wears a quality but modest dark blue wool tunic with simple red trim appropriate for his Facchini status, though his clothing is meticulously clean and well-maintained. Natural light streams through a small warehouse window, illuminating his contemplative face and the warehouse ledger he holds with precision. The background shows carefully organized merchandise, barrels, and shipping crates with exotic markings. His expression is cautiously confident with a hint of strategic planning. A small chapel medal hangs discreetly at his neck. The warehouse setting features authentic Renaissance Venetian architecture with stone arches and wooden beams. The color palette consists of practical earth tones and subdued blues that reflect his working-class position, with occasional touches of quality in his personal effects that hint at his former merchant status and substantial hidden wealth. His posture is dignified yet appropriately humble for his station, standing among the tools of his trade: inventory lists, measuring instruments, and sealed contracts.
