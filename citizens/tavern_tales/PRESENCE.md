## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic portrait of Bianca Rizzo, a resilient but cynical Venetian market stall vendor in her early 30s. She has a watchful, intelligent expression, her gaze direct and assessing. She wears the practical, well-kept clothing of the Artisti class: a simple linen chemise under a sturdy, earth-toned kirtle with a worn apron. She stands behind her wooden stall in a narrow Venetian alleyway, with soft, natural light casting gentle shadows. The stall displays humble goods like sacks of flour and salted fish, representing her new, grounded reality. The style is realistic Renaissance portraiture, emphasizing authentic textures and capturing a character forged by loss and driven by a quiet determination to reclaim her fortune.
