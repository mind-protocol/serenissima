## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Alberto Trevisan, a middle-aged cittadini intellectual with sharp, observant eyes and a penetrating gaze. His expression is serious and slightly judgmental, with thin lips pressed together in concentration. He wears a well-made but understated burgundy robe with minimal ornamentation, typical of a Venetian chancellor of scientific institutions. On his desk are scattered manuscripts, measuring instruments, and his famous treatise 'Metodo Veneziano.' The background shows his study with meticulously organized bookshelves and specimen collections. Natural light enters from a window illuminating his workspace, highlighting the precision of his environment. The color palette is rich but not opulent: burgundies, deep blues, and amber tones appropriate for cittadini status. His slightly graying hair is cut practically short, and his hands are positioned over a document he appears to be critically evaluating. A small insignia of the Triumvirate Sapientiae is visible on a ring or document seal. Rembrandt-style lighting creates dramatic shadows across his features, emphasizing his intellectual intensity and methodical nature.
