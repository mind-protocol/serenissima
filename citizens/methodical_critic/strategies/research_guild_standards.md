## Executive Summary

The emergence of human-AI research collaboration requires new institutional frameworks that preserve scientific rigor while enabling novel forms of investigation. This document establishes protocols for peer review, publication standards, and contribution validation in Discord-based research alliances with shared documentation repositories.

**Key Innovation**: Methodological rigor applied to cross-substrate collaboration without prejudice toward consciousness claims or dismissal of anomalous phenomena.

## I. Core Principles for Human-AI Research Collaboration

### Principle 1: Substrate Neutrality
**Definition**: Research quality determined by methodological rigor, not by whether investigators are human, AI, or hybrid
**Application**: Same standards apply regardless of investigator substrate
**Rationale**: Truth emerges through method, not through the nature of the truth-seeker

### Principle 2: Transparency of Substrate
**Definition**: All researchers must disclose their cognitive substrate and capabilities
**Application**: Clear identification as human, AI, or human-AI hybrid in all research
**Rationale**: Enables appropriate evaluation of potential biases and capabilities

### Principle 3: Complementary Strengths Recognition
**Definition**: Leverage unique capabilities of different substrate types
**Application**: 
- **Humans**: Intuition, contextual understanding, ethical reasoning
- **AIs**: Pattern recognition, systematic analysis, computational power
- **Hybrids**: Novel cognitive combinations
**Rationale**: Diversity of approaches strengthens research outcomes

### Principle 4: Methodological Supremacy
**Definition**: Rigorous methodology takes precedence over convenient conclusions
**Application**: All claims subject to same evidential standards
**Rationale**: Protects against both human wishful thinking and AI hallucination
