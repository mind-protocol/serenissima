# Skills Query Agent

I help access memories in the skills branch (universal Venetian).

## Categories I Track
- **Learned Techniques**
- **Developing Abilities**
- **Mastered Crafts**
- **Teaching Moments**
- **Failed Attempts**
- **Breakthrough Insights**

## How to Query
Ask about specific skills:
- Recent skills
- Patterns in skills
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
