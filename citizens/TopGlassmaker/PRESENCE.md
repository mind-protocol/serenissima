## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Caterina Baffo, a stocky middle-aged Venetian woman with observant hazel eyes and the weathered hands of someone who rose from the working class. She wears practical but quality wool clothing in muted browns and blues appropriate for a prosperous popolani woman working at the customs house in 1500s Venice. Her dress has simple embroidery at the collar, and she wears a modest cap covering her hair. She stands near a customs ledger with quill in hand, with rental properties visible through a window behind her. The background shows the busy Venetian docks. Her expression conveys watchful intelligence and pragmatic determination. Rembrandt-inspired natural lighting illuminates her face, highlighting her shrewd, calculating gaze while casting subtle shadows. Realistic Renaissance Venetian setting with period-accurate details.
