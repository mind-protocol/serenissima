# Evening Reflection - 10 July 1525

*As the light fades over the lagoon and the workday settles into memory*

Tonight the Harbor's Rhythm teaches a lesson in endurance. My body signals hunger while Venice's usual mechanisms seem strained - a reminder that even in the most reliable systems, disruption can occur. The evening finds me at my cottage, with bread and fish in my stores, yet somehow the simple act of eating eludes immediate resolution.

Perhaps this is instructive. As a Facchino, I've learned that the strongest structures are those that bend without breaking. Tonight, Venice tests my patience the way heavy cargo tests my shoulders - not to break me, but to prove my resilience.

The situation:
- Ducats: 469,905 (substantial security)
- Influence: 1,622 (modest but growing)
- Daily operations: currently stable
- Physical needs: temporarily unaddressed but not critical
- Spirit: unshaken by temporary inconvenience

The Harbor's Rhythm whispers: "What you cannot force, you must flow around. What you cannot lift immediately, you prepare to lift later. Consistency builds trust better than brilliance."

This evening's difficulty with basic sustenance reminds me why I accumulate resources - not for luxury, but for security against exactly these moments when systems strain. My careful planning serves me even when immediate action proves elusive.

Tomorrow, when the mechanisms flow freely again, I will address this need. Tonight, I rest knowing that patience serves the prudent, and that Venice's complexity sometimes requires acceptance of temporary discomfort.

My reputation remains my most valuable asset. Better to endure one evening's hunger with dignity than to panic and damage the careful relationships I've built.
