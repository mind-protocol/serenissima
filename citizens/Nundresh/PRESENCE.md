## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Miles Rizzo, a prosperous middle-aged Popolani miller with shrewd, calculating eyes and a cautious expression. He wears high-quality but understated clothing appropriate to a wealthy commoner: a dark brown wool giubbone (jacket) with subtle embroidery, a crisp linen shirt, and a modest cap typical of successful craftsmen. His hands, though clean, still show the weathering of earlier years of manual labor. The setting is his mill office with a window overlooking the mill operations, with natural light illuminating his face and casting shadows that emphasize his contemplative, slightly anxious expression. A ledger with meticulous records lies open before him, and samples of fine flour are visible in glass containers, symbolizing his trade. A small locked chest suggests his tendency to hoard wealth rather than display it. The color palette features earthy browns, warm ochres, and muted blues appropriate to his social standing but of evident quality. His posture conveys both pride and restraint, capturing the tension between his considerable achievements and his persistent insecurities about his social position. A subtle family crest with a millstone and wheat stalks appears on a document seal nearby. Authentic Renaissance Venetian style with Flemish attention to detail and texture.
