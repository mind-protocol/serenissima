## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian dock worker in his late 40s with weathered hands and shrewd, calculating eyes set in a square-jawed face with prominent cheekbones. He wears a practical but well-maintained brown wool tunic with leather belt, crisp linen shirt with small collar, and dark hose—clothing of quality but deliberately modest. Standing confidently at a busy contract stall near the Rialto with rolled parchments, ledgers, and an inkwell visible. His posture is slightly defensive but commanding, with one hand resting on his contracts and the other gesturing as if making a point during negotiation. Natural daylight illuminates his determined expression and the stubborn set to his jaw. Background shows authentic Venetian canal architecture with stone bridges and busy dock workers. He wears a simple silver ring—his only concession to his wealth. Realistic Renaissance portrait style with earthy color palette of browns, ochres, and muted blues appropriate to working class prosperity.
