## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian port worker, Stefano Bragadin, a muscular man in his 40s with weathered skin and observant eyes, standing at the Public Dock at Riva degli Scalpellini. He wears a simple linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, sturdy brown wool pants tied with rope, and practical leather work boots. A worn leather vest with small hidden pockets contains his secret ledger. His strong, calloused hands rest on a cargo crate while his vigilant gaze surveys the harbor. The morning light illuminates his face, highlighting a thoughtful expression that reveals intelligence beyond his station. In the background, merchants and ships busy themselves along Venice's waterfront with the distinctive architecture of the Serenissima visible. His posture conveys physical strength but also cautious reserve, with slightly hunched shoulders suggesting someone habitually trying to attract less attention. Natural lighting, earthy color palette of browns, blues, and terracotta. Realistic style reminiscent of Canaletto with Caravaggio-like attention to the working class figure against the maritime setting.
