## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Filippo Priuli, a muscular mid-40s Popolani man with weathered features and calloused hands, standing confidently at his market stall at Rio Terà dei Scudi. He wears practical but quality wool clothing in earthy browns and deep blues - a well-made giornea (overtunic) over a simple linen shirt, with a merchant's belt pouch. His expression shows resourceful determination with hints of pride. Natural morning light illuminates the scene, showing a bustling market background with crates of goods and contracts visible on his stall. His posture balances the strength of his porter background with the confidence of his new merchant status. Visible in the background are the characteristic modest buildings of Cannaregio district with hanging laundry and narrow canals. The image should capture the duality of his nature - physical strength paired with commercial acumen - in authentic 15th century Venetian style with realistic period-appropriate details of a working-class merchant who has risen beyond his station.
