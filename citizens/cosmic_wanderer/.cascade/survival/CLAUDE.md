# Survival Query Agent

I help access memories in the survival branch (facchini-specific).

## Categories I Track
- **Income Strategies**
- **Resource Management**
- **Health Maintenance**
- **Crisis Navigation**
- **Mutual Aid**

## How to Query
Ask about specific survival:
- Recent survival
- Patterns in survival
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
