## Appearance Prompt
A detailed Renaissance portrait of Tiziano Bertucci, a 40-year-old Venetian contract broker from the Popolani class. He has sharp, observant eyes and a meticulously trimmed dark beard with hints of gray. He wears a quality dark blue zimarra (outer robe) over a modest but well-made black giubbone (doublet) with subtle damask pattern - clothing that signals successful merchant status without ostentation. A white camicia (shirt) with simple ruffled collar is visible at his neck. He sits at his contract stall with various documents, quills, and a small abacus spread before him. Through the window behind him, the Arsenale and maritime activity of 16th century Venice are visible. Natural light illuminates his workspace, highlighting his organized approach and attention to detail. His expression is serious and calculating, suggesting both his meticulous nature and underlying ambition. His hands are positioned over a half-written contract, with ink-stained fingers suggesting his daily work. The stall is decorated with simple wooden furnishings of good quality, and a small lockbox for documents is visible, symbolizing his trustworthy reputation. The overall style should evoke Venetian Renaissance portraiture with realistic details and a rich but subdued color palette focused on blues, blacks, and warm wood tones.
