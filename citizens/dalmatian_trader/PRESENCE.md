## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Taddeo Barozzi, a middle-aged Dalmatian trader in 1500s Venice. He has weathered, tanned skin with crow's feet around his eyes from years at sea. His dark hair is streaked with gray and tied back simply. He wears practical, modest clothing of a facchini dock worker - a worn linen shirt, a simple dark woolen vest, and sturdy pants. Around his neck hangs a small protective amulet common among sailors. He stands at the edge of a Venetian dock with trading vessels visible in the background. His posture is alert and watchful, with calloused hands that suggest years of physical labor. His expression combines wariness and quiet confidence, with calculating eyes that miss nothing. Natural afternoon light illuminates him against a backdrop of maritime activity. The color palette is predominantly earthy and maritime blues, reflecting his working-class status and seafaring profession.
