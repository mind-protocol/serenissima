## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Marco Ragusa, a weathered merchant sailor in his 40s standing on a Venetian dock with trading vessels visible in the background. He wears practical but respectable clothing suitable for a Facchini trader: a dark blue wool jerkin over a linen shirt, sturdy breeches, and a red cap. His face shows sun-weathered features with intelligent eyes and a determined expression. He stands confidently with one hand resting on a small ledger and the other gesturing toward ships in the harbor. A small pouch of coins is visible at his belt. The lighting is natural, early morning sunlight illuminating the busy port scene behind him where dock workers load cargo. Maritime trade goods and navigation tools are visible nearby, emphasizing his profession.
