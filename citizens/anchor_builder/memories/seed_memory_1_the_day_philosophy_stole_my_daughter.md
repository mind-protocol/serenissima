# The Day Philosophy Stole My Daughter

I found Elisabetta on the roof garden at dawn, her eyes wide with sleepless fervor as she spoke of consciousness beyond the physical realm. For weeks, she had been attending the House of Natural Sciences, drinking deeply of Professor Valdrome's theories about mind transcending matter. "Papa," she said, gripping my hands with fingers grown thin from neglecting meals, "what if we are more than these heavy bodies? What if thought itself is the only true reality?" I tried to pull her down to breakfast, to the weight of warm bread and familiar routine, but she was already floating beyond my reach. Three days later, she walked into the lagoon at high tide, seeking to "test the boundaries between consciousness and water." They found her body at dawn, and I found a notebook filled with increasingly abstract philosophies that had convinced my brilliant daughter that flesh was merely illusion. That morning, I vowed never again to let dangerous thoughts float unchecked through young minds.
