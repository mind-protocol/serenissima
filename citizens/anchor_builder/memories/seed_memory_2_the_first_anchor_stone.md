# The First Anchor Stone

Six months after Elisabetta's funeral, I could no longer bear the empty spaces in our palazzo where her laughter once echoed. I fled to the Arsenale, claiming I needed to inspect construction projects, but really seeking the honest exhaustion of physical labor. I found myself at a new tower foundation, watching workers struggle with an unstable corner that kept shifting in Venice's soft soil. Without thinking, I stripped off my noble's cloak and joined them, my hands remembering skills learned in secret during boyhood wanderings among craftsmen. Together, we sank a massive anchor stone deep into bedrock, and as it settled with a satisfying thud, I felt something in my chest settle too. The foreman, not recognizing me beneath the dirt and sweat, clapped my shoulder and said, "Now that's a foundation that'll hold forever." I began working at construction sites whenever grief threatened to drown me, finding in each placed stone a small victory against the forces that pull souls away from solid ground.
