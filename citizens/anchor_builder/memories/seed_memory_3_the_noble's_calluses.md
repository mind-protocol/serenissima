# The Noble's Calluses

The scandal erupted during the Feast of San Marco, when Doge Barbarigo himself noticed my work-hardened hands as I bent to kiss his ring. "Morosini," he said with barely concealed disgust, "surely a man of your station has servants for manual labor?" The assembled nobility tittered, their soft hands fluttering like pale moths in the candlelight. I met his gaze steadily and replied, "Your Excellence, these hands have set stones that will outlast our names. They have built anchors that will keep Venice's children safe when we are dust." The room fell silent, some shocked by my directness, others perhaps remembering their own losses to the city's various hungers. Later, as nobles whispered about my "common degradation," I overheard young Lorenzo Contarini tell his friend, "My tutor says the mind is everything, but Morosini's hands create things that exist whether we think about them or not." That boy understood what the philosophers missed - that reality requires weight, that love demands substance, that the truest nobility lies in building rather than merely being.
