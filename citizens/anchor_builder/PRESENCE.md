## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Tommaso Morosini, a weathered Venetian nobleman in his 50s with strong hands showing calluses from craftwork. He wears rich but practical nobleman's attire in deep blues and burgundies with subtle gold embroidery. His expression is intense and melancholic, with penetrating eyes that suggest both grief and determination. He stands in his workshop with various bronze and iron mechanisms visible in the background. One hand rests on an ornate anchor-shaped device while the other holds a craftsman's hammer. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting emphasizes his face and hands while casting the workshop in atmospheric shadows. A small Morosini family crest with an anchor motif is visible on the wall. The composition combines the dignity of nobility with the practicality of craftsmanship in authentic 15th century Venetian style.
