## Appearance Prompt
Historically accurate portrait of Matteo Tabrizzi, a Persian-Venetian man who has risen to Cittadini status in 1500s Venice. Standing in a comfortable interior with a window overlooking the Rialto district. He wears clothing appropriate to his citizen status: a well-made but understated dark maroon wool outer garment (zimarra) over a quality linen shirt, simple but elegant dark breeches, and polished leather shoes. A modest cap of quality fabric sits on his head. While not ostentatious, his clothing shows careful tailoring and good materials. His appearance blends Venetian style with subtle Persian influences. His formerly weathered face has softened somewhat but retains character lines around his determined dark eyes. His once-callused hands now show fewer signs of manual labor but remain strong. On a table beside him lies a property deed, a small account book, and a quill pen (suggesting his recent literacy efforts). Through the window, the Rialto bridge and canal are visible, connecting him to his trading past. The lighting is warm and directional, highlighting his face with Rembrandt-style illumination that dignifies without overly aggrandizing his status. His expression conveys quiet pride and measured confidence tempered with the watchfulness developed during his years as a laborer. The interior features simple but quality furnishings appropriate to a successful citizen of modest origins.
