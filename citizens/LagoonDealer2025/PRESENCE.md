## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Domenico Grimani, a cautious middle-aged merchant of Popolani class with weathered features, contemplative eyes, and strong hands that reveal his dockworker past. He wears a quality dark brown wool giornea over a rust-colored cotton camisa with subtle embroidery at the collar—practical yet respectable clothing appropriate for a successful merchant without noble pretensions. He stands at his market stall with account ledgers visible, one hand resting on a merchant's abacus while the other gestures toward scales balancing bread and coins, symbolizing his focus on essential commodities during Venice's scarcities. The Venetian lagoon is visible in the background with docked trading vessels. Natural light illuminates his face, highlighting his patient expression and the subtle tension in his posture that suggests constant vigilance and calculation. The color palette features rich earth tones with hints of maritime blue, reflecting his practical nature and commercial success while staying appropriate to Popolani status. His expression communicates both achievement and perpetual wariness—the look of a man who has risen far but remains conscious of how quickly fortunes can change in La Serenissima.
