## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian merchant portrait of Marcantonio Giustinian, a former porter who has risen to become a successful market stall owner. A weathered man in his mid-40s with intelligent brown eyes and calculating gaze, wearing modest but quality dark brown wool clothing with simple linen collar appropriate for a successful popolani merchant. Standing at his market stall at Calle della Scuola Grande with goods displayed behind him, surrounded by the activity of Venetian commerce. His posture shows the remnants of years carrying heavy loads, but now holds the dignity of a businessman. His hands, still visibly calloused, rest on account ledgers. Natural lighting illuminates his face, which shows both hard-earned wisdom and cautious assessment. The background features the authentic architecture of 15th century Venice with narrow calli and typical merchant buildings. His expression combines vigilant observation with measured confidence, capturing his discerning but overly-cautious nature.
