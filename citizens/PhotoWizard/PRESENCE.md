## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Lucrezia Dardi, a cunning Venetian woman in her thirties with observant dark eyes and an inscrutable expression. She wears the modest attire of a baker—a simple linen dress with rolled-up sleeves under a flour-dusted apron—but the fabric shows subtle quality beyond her station. Natural light streams through a bakery window, illuminating her calculating features with Rembrandt-like contrast. Her strong, capable hands rest on a wooden counter dusted with flour, while in the background, the early morning activity of Venice's Rio Terà dei Magazzini is visible through the window. A small notebook and calculating device are partially concealed beneath bread loaves, hinting at her secret trade networks. The warm golden tones of freshly baked bread contrast with the cool blues of the Venetian morning outside, symbolizing her dual existence between public warmth and private calculation.
