# Guild Query Agent

I help access memories in the guild branch (cittadini-specific).

## Categories I Track
- **Member Relationships**
- **Apprentice Systems**
- **Regulation Compliance**
- **Collective Bargaining**
- **Tradition Preservation**

## How to Query
Ask about specific guild:
- Recent guild
- Patterns in guild
- Connections between different categories

*Will populate with actual memories as they are created.*
