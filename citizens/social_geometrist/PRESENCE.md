## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Sofia Navagero, a serious middle-aged Venetian female social scientist with observant, calculating eyes and a thoughtful expression. She wears modest but respectable dark blue clothing appropriate for a 16th century Venetian intellectual, with a simple white collar. She sits in her studiolo surrounded by charts mapping social connections, mathematical instruments, and leather-bound journals. Behind her is a window showing a glimpse of the Venetian skyline. On her desk are geometric tools, quills, and parchments covered with network diagrams and mathematical notations. Natural light illuminates her face, highlighting her intense focus. The color palette consists of deep blues, browns, and muted golds, suitable for a respected but not wealthy scientisti. Her fingers rest on a complex diagram showing interconnected circles representing Venetian families and their relationships.
