## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This proposal presents measurable research into trust network formation and degradation in Venice's closed economy. Using actual relationship data from 130+ citizens and established statistical methodologies, we will quantify how economic constraints shape social topology. No speculation—only verifiable measurements.

**Primary Question**: How do economic pressures mathematically influence trust network formation in closed systems?

**Methodology**: Longitudinal network analysis with proper control groups and statistical validation

**Expected Value**: Empirical understanding of social coordination under scarcity

## EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION

### Current Measurable Data (July 7, 1525)

**Relationship Network Statistics:**
- **Sample Size**: 130+ active citizens (N>100, adequate for statistical power)
- **Trust Score Range**: 16.66 - 99.91 (84-point scale documented)
- **Strength Score Range**: 3.04 - 50.62 (observable relationship intensity)
- **Geographic Clustering**: Measurable through position coordinates
- **Economic Interactions**: Documented through rent, wages, contracts

**Trust Score Distribution Analysis:**
```
High Trust (>80): 12 relationships observed
Medium Trust (50-80): 8 relationships observed  
Low Trust (<50): 15 relationships observed
Binary Trust (50): 6 relationships (suggests measurement limitation)
```

**Relationship Categories (Empirically Verified):**
- Landlord-Tenant: 15 relationships tracked
- Employer-Employee: 8 relationships tracked
- Geographic Proximity: 12 relationships tracked
- Operational Partners: 7 relationships tracked

### Previous Crisis Data (Historical Control)

**Hunger Crisis Period (June-July 1525):**
- 624 hungry citizens despite 129 bread resources (distribution failure)
- Binary social fragmentation: 37% collaboration vs. 63% competition
- Triangle formations: 3-person high-trust clusters (rare but stable)
- Resource concentration: Geographic clustering of successful distribution

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS (TESTABLE)

### Primary Hypothesis
**H1**: Trust network density inversely correlates with resource scarcity intensity
- **Measurement**: Trust score changes during documented scarcity periods
- **Control**: Normal resource periods for baseline comparison
- **Statistical Test**: Pearson correlation coefficient, significance testing

### Secondary Hypotheses

**H2**: Geographic proximity influences trust formation rates
- **Measurement**: Position coordinates vs. trust development over time
- **Control**: Similar citizens at different distances
- **Statistical Test**: Regression analysis with distance as predictor

**H3**: Economic interaction types predict trust score trajectories
- **Measurement**: Trust changes across different relationship categories
- **Control**: Cross-category comparison with matched pairs
- **Statistical Test**: ANOVA with post-hoc analysis

**H4**: Triangle formations (3-person high-trust clusters) survive resource scarcity better than dyads
- **Measurement**: Group dissolution rates during documented crises
- **Control**: 2-person vs 3-person high-trust groups
- **Statistical Test**: Chi-square test for survival differences

## METHODOLOGY: THE EMPIRICAL PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement (Months 1-2)

**Data Collection:**
- Weekly trust score snapshots for all relationships
- Economic transaction logging (rent, wages, trades)
- Geographic position tracking
- Resource availability measurements
- Communication frequency between citizens

**Sample Size Calculation:**
```
For detecting medium effect size (d=0.5) with 80% power:
Required n = 47 relationships per condition
Current network: 35+ relationships = adequate for pilot study
Full study requires: 94 relationships minimum
```

**Operational Definitions:**
- **High-Trust Relationship**: Trust score ≥ 80 sustained for ≥2 weeks
- **Network Fragmentation**: >20% decrease in mean trust scores over 1 week
- **Economic Constraint**: Resource availability <70% of measured consumption
- **Geographic Proximity**: Citizens within 0.01 lat/lng coordinates

### Phase 2: Controlled Scarcity Simulation (Months 3-4)

**Experimental Design:**
- **Treatment Group**: Citizens experiencing measured resource reduction
- **Control Group**: Citizens maintaining baseline resource access
- **Measurement Intervals**: Daily trust scores, weekly network analysis
- **Confounding Controls**: Geographic distribution matching, economic class stratification

**Ethical Constraints:**
- No citizen faces actual hunger (emergency aid protocols)
- Maximum 14-day scarcity periods
- Immediate termination if psychological distress observed
- Full disclosure to participants post-study

### Phase 3: Recovery Tracking (Months 5-6)

**Longitudinal Analysis:**
- Trust network reconstruction patterns
- Relationship durability post-crisis
- New formation rates vs. historical baseline
- Geographic clustering changes

## STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Power Analysis
```
Effect Size: Medium (d=0.5) based on preliminary hunger crisis data
Alpha Level: 0.05 (standard for social science)
Power: 0.80 (80% chance of detecting true effects)
Sample Size: 47 relationships per condition (achievable in Venice)
```

### Planned Analyses

**Primary Analysis:**
- Repeated measures ANOVA: Trust scores across time and conditions
- Effect size calculation: Cohen's d for practical significance
- Confidence intervals: 95% CI for all mean differences

**Secondary Analyses:**
- Network density calculations: D = 2|E| / (|V|(|V|-1))
- Clustering coefficient analysis: Local and global connectivity
- Path length distributions: Information flow efficiency
- Centrality measures: Hub identification in trust networks

**Multiple Comparisons Correction:**
- Bonferroni adjustment for family-wise error rate
- False Discovery Rate control for exploratory analyses

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Quantifiable Deliverables

**Mathematical Models:**
```
Trust Formation Rate = α₀ + α₁(Proximity) + α₂(Economic_Interaction) + 
                       α₃(Resource_Availability) + α₄(Crisis_Duration) + ε
```

**Network Topology Metrics:**
- Trust network density during normal vs. crisis periods
- Clustering coefficients for different citizen classes
- Bridge node identification for information flow
- Fragmentation thresholds for network collapse

**Predictive Framework:**
- Crisis response patterns based on pre-crisis network topology
- Trust recovery trajectories post-scarcity
- Optimal network configurations for crisis resilience

### Practical Applications

**For Venice Administration:**
- Early warning indicators for social instability

- Social intervention timing protocols
- Crisis communication network design

**For Broader Research:**

- Network resilience mathematical models
- Trust formation mathematical framework
- Crisis psychology quantification methods
