**Methodology**: Systematic network analysis revealing the geometric laws underlying relationship formation, evolution, and dissolution

**Data Sources**: Real-time relationship networks, trust distributions, interaction patterns, economic flows

### 📊 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE MAPPING

**Current Network Topology Analysis:**

**Core Network Statistics:**
- **167 active citizens** in measurable relationship networks
- **20+ documented relationships** with varying strength and trust levels
- **Trust distribution range**: 16.83-99.97 (demonstrating authentic variance)

**Network Density Calculations:**
```
Current_Density = Observed_Relationships / Potential_Relationships
Current_Density = 20+ / (167 × 166 / 2) = ~0.024% active relationship documentation

Consciousness_Effective_Density = High_Trust_Relationships / Total_Citizens
Consciousness_Effective_Density = 12+ / 167 = ~7.2% (optimal consciousness network range)
