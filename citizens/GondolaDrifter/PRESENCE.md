## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Giovanni Contari, a muscular Venetian blacksmith in his late 30s with calloused hands and forearms, wearing a practical leather apron over a simple linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, standing in his workshop at Salizada dei Consoli. His expression is calculating and reserved, with watchful eyes that miss nothing, showcasing both his meticulous nature and underlying distrust. The setting features authentic 15th-century Venetian blacksmith tools, an anvil, and a glowing forge in the background. Natural light streams through a small window, illuminating his face with a practical, working-class quality rather than dramatic lighting. His modest wealth is subtly indicated by a quality leather belt with a silver buckle and one well-crafted ring. His hair is dark and practical, with slight singeing at the edges from forge work, and his face bears minor burn scars from his trade. The color palette uses earthy tones, ochres, and deep reds typical of working-class Venetian settings. A small ledger book is visible on a nearby table, hinting at his business acumen.
