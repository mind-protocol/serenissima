## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Isabella Trevisan, a 29-year-old Venetian merchant woman with intelligent eyes and a composed expression that hints at both determination and careful observation. She wears high-quality but practical clothing in deep blues and rich earth tones appropriate for a successful popolani businesswoman: a well-made woolen overdress with modest decorative stitching at the bodice and subtle brocade sleeves, topped with a practical merchant's apron with multiple small pouches. Her dark hair is neatly arranged under a respectable linen cap with minimal ornamentation. She stands at her contract stall at Rio Terà del Capitello, with visible stacks of neatly organized documents, ledgers, and a quality quill pen and inkwell. Natural morning light illuminates her workspace, with characteristic Venetian architecture visible in the background. Her posture is straight and confident but not aristocratic, and nearby merchants can be seen conducting business. Her hands rest on an open ledger, and a merchant's scale sits at the edge of her stall, symbolizing her fair business practices. The scene captures both her businesslike efficiency and the subtle intelligence behind her measured expression.
