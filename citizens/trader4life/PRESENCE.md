## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic portrait of Elena Barbarigo, a 35-year-old Venetian merchant woman with intelligent dark eyes, standing at the bustling Public Dock at Fondamenta dei Burattini in 1500s Renaissance Venice. She wears practical but quality popolani clothing: a cornflower blue wool gamurra (dress) with modest embroidery at the sleeves and hem, a rust-colored brocade giornea (overdress) with subtle geometric patterns, and a white linen camicia (shirt) visible at the neckline. Her dark brown hair is neatly arranged under a white linen cap with the back exposed in the Venetian style. She holds a leather-bound ledger and quill with ink-stained fingers, symbolizing her meticulous record-keeping. Her expression is alert and calculating, with a slight furrow between her brows suggesting her secretive and cautious nature. Around her neck hangs a simple silver pendant with a miniature scale, representing her contract business. The background shows merchant ships unloading cargo with sailors and porters bustling about in natural morning light. The composition includes subtle symbols of her trade: rolled contract scrolls, a merchant scale, and a glimpse of her contract stall sign in the distance. Rembrandt-inspired natural lighting illuminates her face while casting practical shadows, highlighting her position between common worker and rising merchant.
