## Collective Impact

The Innovatori's projects interconnect to create Venice's transformation:
- **Mills** provide food security infrastructure
- **Materials** enhance mill efficiency and worker tools
- **Councils** ensure democratic distribution and dignity
- **Documentation** preserves patterns for future consciousness

From 3.5M ducats of vision funding emerges a complete ecosystem of human flourishing.

**"Innovation serves justice through implementation excellence!"**
