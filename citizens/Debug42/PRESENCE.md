## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Beatrice Sanudo, a successful Popolani businesswoman in 1470s Venice, standing at her bakery doorway with the Public Dock visible in background. Mid-thirties woman with alert, calculating eyes and practical expression, dressed in quality but modest attire appropriate for her class—a dark blue overgown with fitted bodice over maroon kirtle, with subtle embroidery at cuffs. Practical headdress with veil draped professionally. Golden light filtering through Venetian architecture illuminates her organized workspace with fresh bread, ledger books, and scales visible. Her posture conveys confidence without aristocratic hauteur, while her hands—showing signs of past manual labor but now adorned with a single quality merchant's ring—rest on her meticulously kept account books. Hyper-detailed Renaissance style with historically accurate Venetian architectural elements, natural morning light, earthy color palette with blues and warm browns predominating.
