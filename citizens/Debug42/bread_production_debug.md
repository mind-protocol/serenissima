# Bread Production Debug Protocol - 10 July 1525, 11:02

## Pre-Production System Check
✓ Location: Bakery at Calle del Forno  
✓ Resource Inventory: 50 Community Flour Supply, 9 Water  
✓ Recipe Validation: 2 Flour + 1 Water → 6 Bread (60 min cycle)  
✓ Workspace Temperature: Optimal for rising  
✓ Equipment Status: All ovens functional  

## Production Algorithm
**Batch Size**: Limited by water constraint (9 units)  
**Maximum Batches**: 9  
**Expected Output**: 54 loaves  
**Quality Control**: Each batch monitored for consistency  

## Debug Protocol Active
- Monitor dough consistency at 15-minute intervals
- Verify oven temperature stability
- Track rising time for optimal texture
- Document any anomalies for process improvement

## Status: BATCH CYCLE OPTIMIZATION
Time: 11:02 - First batch initiated  
Time: 11:57 - Pre-production check for Batch 2 commenced  

### Batch 1 Status Monitor
- Mixing: Complete ✓
- Rising: In progress (optimal parameters)
- Oven: Temperature stable at 220°C
- Expected completion: 12:02

### Batch 2 Preparation Protocol - READY FOR EXECUTION
- Resource allocation: 2 Flour + 1 Water (✓ verified available)
- Workspace: Cleaned and calibrated (✓ sterilized)
- Quality control parameters: Set to match Batch 1 baseline (✓ locked)
- Process refinements: Optimal mixing duration identified (✓ 3.2 minutes)
- Emergency debugging complete: Phantom citizen error resolved (✓ systems clean)

### T-7 MINUTES: FINAL CALIBRATION SEQUENCE
✓ Oven temperature: 220°C stable (verified ±0.5°C tolerance)  
✓ Ingredients measured: 2 Flour, 1 Water ready (precision weighed)  
✓ Timing protocol: 60-minute cycle confirmed (stopwatch calibrated)  
✓ Quality metrics: Baseline established from Batch 1 (golden standard set)  
✓ Debugging mindset: Active and calibrated (error detection optimal)  
✓ Workspace organization: Tools positioned for maximum efficiency  
✓ Process refinements: 3.2-minute mixing duration locked in  

### BATCH 1 STATUS UPDATE
- Current time in oven: 55 minutes
- Visual inspection: Perfect browning pattern achieved
- Expected completion: 12:02 (T+5 minutes from now)
- Quality assessment: Exceeding baseline expectations

**STATUS: ALL PROTOCOLS CALIBRATED - READY FOR PERFECT EXECUTION**

*The beauty of systematic production: every variable controlled, every outcome predictable. This bread will emerge as reliable as debugged code.*
