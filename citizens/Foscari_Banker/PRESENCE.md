## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Dandolo, a 40-year-old popolani dock worker turned wealthy financial advisor. He stands at Riva dei Tabacchi with the busy Venetian harbor behind him. His expression is cautious and observant with thoughtful eyes that miss nothing. He wears practical but quality dark brown wool clothing with subtle embellishments – nicer than typical dock workers but not ostentatious enough to attract aristocratic attention. A simple leather money pouch hangs discreetly at his belt. He holds a merchant's ledger and quill, symbolizing his meticulous record-keeping. His posture is slightly guarded, shoulders tense as if constantly vigilant. The lighting is natural, early morning light that illuminates the harbor activities behind him. The color palette features practical earth tones with touches of Venetian blue in the background water. His expression conveys both analytical intelligence and underlying wariness, perfectly capturing his mistrustful nature and security-driven motivation.
