## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Canon Matteo Contarini, a middle-aged Venetian clergyman from the noble Contarini family, standing in his richly appointed study in San Marco. He wears the black cassock and mozzetta of a canon with a pectoral cross of fine silver workmanship. His expression is contemplative yet assured, with slight arrogance in his gaze. Behind him are shelves of leather-bound theological texts and merchant ledgers. On his desk rests his famous treatise 'Mercatura et Providentia' alongside a golden chalice and an ornate inkwell. Light streams through a stained-glass window bearing the Contarini family crest, creating Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting that highlights his aristocratic features and tonsured head. His hands rest on an open Bible with margin notes, suggesting his work interpreting scripture for commercial purposes. His subtle half-smile conveys both piety and calculation. Renaissance Venetian architecture visible through an open window. Realistic 16th century style, detailed ecclesiastical garments.
