## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Antonio Contarini, a 60s Venetian baker and former dockworker with Popolani social standing. Muscular but aging man with flour-dusted hands, trimmed white beard, and calculating eyes. Wearing practical dark brown wool clothes with a baker's apron, standing in doorway of his modest bakery. Morning light illuminates his weathered face showing resilience and suspicion. Background shows Venetian canal and modest commercial district. Natural lighting appropriate for working class, earthy color palette of browns, creams, and muted blues. Realistic Renaissance style showing his transition from physical laborer to business owner. His expression shows pride in achievement but wariness of those around him.
