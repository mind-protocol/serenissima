## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of a middle-aged Cypriot merchant in 1500s Venice, weathered olive-skinned face with alert dark eyes and graying beard, dressed in simple but well-maintained brown wool doublet over linen shirt with modest collar, standing at his contract stall at Fondamenta dei Vetrai with natural morning light illuminating the scene. His posture shows quiet dignity despite his Facchini class, one hand rests on a ledger while the other gestures toward contract scrolls arranged on his modest wooden stall. The background reveals glimpses of Venice's canals and glass-making district with subdued earthy tones of ochre, burnt sienna and muted blues. His expression combines shrewdness with cautious ambition, subtle crow's feet suggesting years of careful observation, while a merchant's scale and inkwell visible nearby symbolize his trade. The composition follows Renaissance portraiture conventions with realistic details but simpler setting appropriate to his social standing.
