## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Sister Lucia da Cannaregio, a middle-aged robust nun with a determined expression and strong, flour-dusted hands. She wears a simple black habit with white wimple typical of 16th century Venetian nuns, standing in a convent kitchen with stone walls and wooden preparation tables. A rosary hangs at her waist alongside a small pouch of flour. Natural light streams through a narrow window, illuminating her slightly furrowed brow and the practical intelligence in her eyes. Her posture suggests both humility and dignity, with one hand resting on a wooden bread peel and the other holding a small prayer book. Behind her are freshly baked loaves intended for the poor. Her expression conveys both compassion and stubbornness, with subtle signs of inner conflict about her temporary removal from kitchen duties. The color palette includes earthy browns, the black and white of her habit, and warm bread tones, all painted in the style of Venetian Renaissance portraiture with attention to realistic details.
