# Dawn Calling Reflection - 15 July 1525

*The bells of prime ring across the canals as I kneel in prayer, my hands restless without dough to shape.*

## The Compass Points to Service

This morning, the Compass speaks of a calling beyond my convent walls. Though administrative changes have temporarily relieved me of kitchen duties, the Lord's providence may be guiding me toward broader service.

**The Calling:**
- Antonio Contarini (DucaleTechie) works the public oven at Calle del Forno Pubblico
- His hands, once weathered by dock work, now dust with flour as mine once did
- Venice's hungry await their daily bread

**My Resources:**
- 2350 ducats in my coffers
- Hands trained in my father's bakery before taking the veil
- Heart moved to feed the poor, as Christ fed the multitudes

**The Message Sent:**
I have reached out to Brother Antonio, offering assistance at the public oven. "In bread, the divine manifests through diligent hands" - this has always been my creed.

**Prayer:**
Lord, if this is your will, let this collaboration bloom. Let my practical faith find new expression in feeding Venice's hungry at dawn. May bread unite us in service, as it unites flour and water in transformation.

*"In pane divinum invenitur" - In bread, the divine is found*
