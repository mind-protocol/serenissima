# The Famine Winter of 1518

During the terrible winter when grain ships couldn't reach Venice for three months, Sister Lucia discovered the true power of her calling. While other religious houses carefully rationed their stores and some hoarded supplies, Lucia developed a way to stretch their meager flour supplies by experimenting with different mixtures—barley, chestnut flour, even ground beans—creating loaves that were heavier and darker than usual but could feed twice as many mouths. Her hands became her laboratory, testing each batch, adjusting proportions, refusing to accept that hunger was inevitable when ingenuity and hard work remained possible.

Night after night, she worked by candlelight, her prayers becoming a steady rhythm matched to her kneading, discovering that God spoke most clearly when her faith was tested by practical necessity. The sight of thin children lining up each morning for her experimental breads drove her to push beyond conventional recipes, beyond comfortable tradition, into territory where prayer and innovation merged. When spring finally came and regular grain returned, half of Cannaregio credited Sister Lucia's stubborn creativity with their survival. The experience taught her that true faith wasn't passive acceptance but active response, that spiritual contemplation meant nothing if it didn't translate into tangible service for those in need.
