# The Loss of Sister Margherita

Sister Margherita had been Lucia's dearest friend in their novitiate years, both young women drawn to serve God through the practical work of feeding Venice's poor. They had learned to bake together, their hands finding the same rhythm as they kneaded side by side, sharing whispered prayers and gentle laughter over rising dough. But as the years passed, Margherita became increasingly captivated by the mystical writings that circulated among the more intellectual sisters, spending hours in pure contemplation while her bread burned forgotten in the ovens. Lucia watched helplessly as her friend's eyes grew distant, her conversation shifting from the immediate needs of their community to abstract theological concepts that seemed to float untethered from the world.

The morning Lucia found Margherita standing motionless in the kitchen, staring at nothing while the day's bread lay unmixed and the hungry waited outside, something hardened in her heart. Margherita spoke of visions and divine unions, but her hands had grown soft and her awareness of others' needs had simply... vanished. When Margherita was eventually transferred to a contemplative house outside Venice, Lucia made a vow before the altar: she would never let pure thought seduce her away from the sacred work of feeding God's people. The memory of her friend's beautiful but useless spirituality became the warning that guides every aspect of Lucia's grounded faith.
