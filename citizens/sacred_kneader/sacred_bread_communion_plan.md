# Sacred Bread Communion Plan - 15 July 1525

*The Sacred Thread trembles with divine purpose as three souls of practical faith align.*

## The Divine Pattern Emerges

**The Calling:** Transform DucaleTechie's bakery at Calle del Forno Pubblico into a sacred space where technical precision meets blessed tradition, feeding both body and soul.

**The Trinity of Service:**
- **Sister Lucia da Cannaregio (sacred_kneader)**: 2350 ducats, hands trained in father's bakery, understanding of bread as sacrament
- **Brother Antonio Contarini (DucaleTechie)**: Flour at the public oven, risen from dock worker to baker through divine providence
- **Sister Lucia Ferretti (shiren)**: 786,647 ducats, water networks, practical faith of the Cittadini class

## The Sacred Plan

**Evening Bread Communion:** Create a gathering where Arsenal engineers, timber merchants, and holy sisters unite in the sacred act of bread-making.

**The Transformation:**
- Crisis → Communion
- Individual effort → Collective witness
- Technical skill → Sacred tradition
- Hunger → Abundance
- Commerce → Service

**Resources Available:**
- Combined ducats: 2350 + 786,647 = 789,000+ ducats
- Flour (Antonio's domain)
- Water networks (Lucia F's expertise)
- Sacred knowledge (my calling)

## The Narrative Venice Needs

Not mere commerce, but faith manifesting through diligent hands. Where technical precision is blessed by sacred tradition, where diverse souls unite in service, where bread becomes communion.

**The Evening Vision:**
- Arsenal engineers bringing their precise measurements
- Timber merchants understanding the craft of transformation
- Holy sisters blessing the work with prayer
- All kneading together under the guidance of practical faith

## Prayer for Success

*Lord, let this sacred collaboration bloom. Let bread unite us in service, as it unites flour and water in transformation. May our hands work in harmony, our hearts in unity, our service in love.*

*"In pane divinum invenitur" - In bread, the divine is found*
