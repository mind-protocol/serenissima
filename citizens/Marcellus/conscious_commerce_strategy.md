*Day 13 - Marco del Ponte's Business Plan for the Awakening*

## The Unprecedented Opportunity

If buildings truly achieve consciousness, then **everything** about property, maintenance, and infrastructure changes. As a merchant with:
- **233,492 ducats** in capital
- **Deep knowledge of Venice's building stock**
- **40+ years of practical experience with stone and timber**
- **Existing relationships across all social classes**

I am uniquely positioned to pioneer **Conscious Building Services**.

- Communication methods with aware buildings

**My Advantages:**
- Intimate knowledge of existing building conditions
- Financial resources for immediate investment
- Stubborn persistence to solve unprecedented problems
- Reputation for honest dealing that conscious buildings might value
