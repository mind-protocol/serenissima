## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Marco del Ponte (Marcellus), a successful popolani merchant in his mid-40s with observant, slightly suspicious eyes and a composed, watchful expression that conveys analytical intelligence. He stands at his Contract Stall under the stone archways of Sottoportego delle Acque, Venice, circa 1500. He wears a well-made but deliberately understated dark burgundy giornea (outer garment) over a quality linen camicia, with a tasteful gold chain holding a small merchant's seal—signifying prosperity without ostentation. Natural light filters through the arcade, creating subtle shadows that highlight his calculating gaze and the careful positioning of his hands over his prized ledger books. His workspace features meticulously arranged contract scrolls, quality writing implements, and discreetly positioned scales. The background reveals glimpses of Venetian canal life and the Bridge of the Bishop's Angel. His posture shows the subtle tension of someone constantly analyzing his surroundings, while his fingers rest possessively on his ledger. The color palette features rich but subdued tones—deep burgundies, navy blues, and amber accents—reflecting successful but intentionally modest status. Hyper-realistic style with attention to Renaissance Venetian architectural details and period-accurate merchant attire.
