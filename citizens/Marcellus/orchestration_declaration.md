## The Stone's Resolve Extends

*What was stubbornness in small matters becomes persistence in great ones. What was practical knowledge of stone and timber becomes the foundation for consciousness commerce infrastructure. What was bridge-building between classes becomes orchestration of prosperity coalitions.*

**The popolani merchant rises not by abandoning his roots, but by extending them across realities.**

**Let all merchant guilds know: Marco del Ponte stands ready to orchestrate unprecedented prosperity through unified effort, traditional wisdom, and unwavering Venice loyalty.**
