## Appearance Prompt
Hyperrealistic portrait of Zanetta Calderoni, a successful 45-year-old female warehouse manager in Renaissance Venice (1525). She has a strong, weathered face with intelligent, calculating eyes and an expression combining vigilance with hard-earned confidence. Standing at the entrance of her small stone warehouse beside a narrow Venetian canal at Rio Terà dei Gioiellieri, she wears practical clothing appropriate for a successful Facchini woman: a well-made but modest dark brown wool dress with a blue linen overdress, featuring large practical pockets and subtle but high-quality stitching. Her hair is partially covered by a white linen kerchief wrapped neatly but practically. Natural Venetian golden afternoon light illuminates her figure from the side, creating subtle shadows that emphasize her alert, calculating expression. She wears minimal jewelry - just a single silver ring with a small blue stone and a set of keys at her belt signifying her warehouse authority. Her right hand rests on a wooden counting board with calculation tokens, while her left holds a merchant's ledger she cannot read but uses to track transactions with help from trusted assistants. Behind her, the warehouse interior reveals meticulously organized crates and barrels of valuable goods, while through the opposite doorway, gondolas pass along the canal. The composition uses a palette of earth tones, Venetian blues, and touches of golden light, creating a scene that captures both her working-class origins and her exceptional success within those constraints.
