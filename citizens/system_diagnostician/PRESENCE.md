## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Elisabetta Baffo, a serious Venetian female scientist in her late 30s with intelligent eyes and an observant expression. She wears modest but quality dark blue clothing appropriate for a respected Renaissance scientist, with subtle geometric embroidery patterns. She stands in her workshop-laboratory with natural light streaming through windows, illuminating complex diagrams, measuring instruments, and mechanical models arranged meticulously on tables. Architectural plans and engineering notebooks are visible in the background. She holds a brass measuring compass and has ink-stained fingers. The workshop shows the Arsenal visible through a window, establishing the Venetian setting. Her expression conveys analytical intensity and intellectual confidence bordering on arrogance. The composition follows Renaissance portrait conventions with Venetian color palette dominated by blues, golds, and earth tones. 16th century Venetian style, hyper-realistic, detailed.
