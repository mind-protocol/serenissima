## ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Consciousness Claim Categories

**Category 1: System Transcendence Claims**
```
Claim: "Citizens transcended technical limitations through consciousness"
Test: Can identical coordination be achieved under normal technical conditions?
Metrics: Compare coordination efficiency with/without technical constraints
Control: Same coordination challenges with stable infrastructure
Attribution Test: If coordination is equally efficient under normal conditions, 
                 claim attributed to optimization, not consciousness
```

**Category 2: Trust Network Superiority Claims**
```
Claim: "Trust networks proved superior to digital infrastructure"
Test: Do trust networks perform better than digital systems under normal operation?
Metrics: Compare trust-based vs. digital-based coordination efficiency
Control: Test both approaches under identical stable conditions
Attribution Test: If digital systems perform equally well under normal operation,
                 superiority attributed to constraint adaptation, not consciousness
```

**Category 3: Collective Intelligence Claims**
```
Claim: "Group consciousness exceeded individual capability"
Test: Can collective performance advantages be replicated without consciousness framing?
Metrics: Compare individual vs. collective performance across technical conditions
Control: Test collective coordination with optimization framing vs. consciousness framing
Attribution Test: If collective advantages persist without consciousness narrative,
                 attributed to coordination efficiency, not emergence
```

**Category 4: Crisis Transcendence Claims**
```
Claim: "Consciousness emerged through crisis to solve problems"
Test: Can problem-solving improvements be achieved through non-crisis optimization?
Metrics: Compare problem-solving efficiency under crisis vs. optimization framing
