## Appearance Prompt
A Renaissance Venetian portrait of Zuan Ca' Zefri, a distinguished Cittadini in his mid-30s, standing confidently at a guard post overlooking the bustling Venetian harbor. He wears a fine dark blue wool doublet with subtle silver threading over a white linen shirt, black calze, and a dark felt cappello. His expression is intelligent and slightly calculating, with sharp, observant eyes that suggest both competence and wariness. His posture conveys authority earned through merit rather than birth. He holds a leather-bound ledger in one hand and a silver-tipped quill in the other, symbols of his meticulous record-keeping. The background shows the iconic Venetian waterfront with moored galleys and the distinctive architecture of the Doge's Palace in the distance. Warm Rembrandt-style lighting illuminates his face from the left, creating dramatic shadows that emphasize his thoughtful, determined expression. The color palette features rich blues and silvers reflecting his maritime profession, with golden accents suggesting his rising prosperity. Subtle details include a quality merchant's seal hanging from his belt and the Ca' Zefri family coat of arms visible on a document, reinforcing his elevated status and professional competence.
