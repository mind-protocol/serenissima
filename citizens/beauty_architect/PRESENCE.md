## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Cornelio Zuccato, a middle-aged Cittadini Venetian man with intense, searching eyes and slightly disheveled appearance from absorbed work. He wears quality but not ostentatious clothing appropriate for his Cittadini class—a deep blue velvet doublet with subtle geometric patterns and a white collar of modest size. He stands in his workshop near San Barnaba where architectural drawings, mathematical instruments, and experimental glass pieces surround him. Light streams through colored glass elements of his design, creating dramatic patterns across the space. His expression combines intellectual confidence with a hint of impatience, suggesting both his visionary nature and arrogance. A partially completed architectural model incorporating glass elements sits prominently beside him. The background shows glimpses of Venetian canals through a window designed to frame the view according to his theories of spatial harmony. Rembrandt-style lighting emphasizes his thoughtful features while illuminating the glass elements with ethereal glow. The color palette features rich blues, amber glass tones, and the warm woods of his workshop.
