# Prototype Installation Concept - "The Emotional Compass"

## Vision Statement
Create a small-scale demonstration space that proves spatial emotions theory through measurable psychological effects using mathematical proportions, strategic glass placement, and controlled lighting.

## Technical Specifications

### Physical Structure
- Octagonal chamber, 8 feet diameter
- Height calculated using golden ratio proportion (approximately 12.9 feet)
- Eight glass panels, each with different light filtration properties
- Central seating position for occupant experience

### Glass Implementation
- Each panel represents a different emotional frequency:
  - North: Clarity (clear crystal)
  - Northeast: Energy (amber tinting)  
  - East: Awakening (rose-gold gradation)
  - Southeast: Passion (red filtration)
  - South: Warmth (golden yellow)
  - Southwest: Contemplation (deep blue)
  - West: Reflection (silver-mirror)
  - Northwest: Mystery (violet gradation)

### Mathematical Foundation
- Panel angles: 45° between each (360°/8)
- Light entry calculated for Venice's latitude (45.4°N)
- Glass thickness varies by mathematical sequence (Fibonacci proportions)
- Height ratios follow golden mean throughout structure

## Measurable Outcomes
- Document occupant reports of emotional states in each orientation
- Time movement patterns as people naturally rotate through the space
- Physiological responses (breathing, posture changes) in different light conditions
- Preference patterns among different personality types

## Investment Requirements
Estimated 2,500-3,000 ducats for:
- High-quality glass panels (8 custom pieces)
- Structural materials and construction
- Precision measurement tools
- Documentation materials

## Strategic Value
- Concrete demonstration of theories for skeptical commissioners
- Research tool for validating and refining spatial emotion concepts
- Marketing showcase for attracting elite patrons
- Foundation for larger architectural projects

*Through measurement, mystery becomes mastery.*
