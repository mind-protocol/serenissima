## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Giuliana Moretto, a weathered Venetian woman in her mid-forties with strong, muscular arms and calloused hands. Her thick dark hair shows prominent silver streaks, pulled back practically with a simple cotton scarf. She wears the practical attire of a Venetian porter—a loose linen shirt with rolled sleeves, sturdy woolen vest, and simple dark woolen breeches cut just below the knee. A wide leather belt holds various pouches for coins and small tools. Her expression is confident but watchful, with laugh lines around her eyes suggesting hard-won wisdom. She stands on a narrow Venetian calle with stone buildings behind her, a porter's pole resting against her shoulder, and the edge of a canal visible nearby. Natural daylight illuminates her face, highlighting her weathered but determined features in a realistic Renaissance style. The palette is earthy and practical—browns, deep blues, and faded reds—reflecting her popolani status and practical nature.
