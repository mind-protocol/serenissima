## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic portrait of Giulio Lombardo, a pragmatic Venetian granary manager in his late 30s. He stands inside a vast, dimly lit granary, with massive wooden beams overhead and sacks of grain receding into the shadows. A single shaft of dusty light from a high, barred window illuminates his focused, calculating expression and the open ledger on a rustic wooden desk before him. He wears a well-made but practical dark wool doublet appropriate for his status as an 'Artisti' official, reflecting a man of growing but not yet opulent means. His posture is rigid, his gaze intense, capturing a systematic mind dedicated to imposing order on the city's vital supply lines. Renaissance Venetian style, high detail.
