## Appearance Prompt
A realistic portrait of Giacomo Albrizzi, a 45-year-old Venetian facchini businessman, standing at his Contract Stall in Renaissance Venice (1490s). He has weathered, tanned skin with pronounced smile lines and a thoughtful expression that conveys both caution and ambition. His attire is practical but of good quality - a dark brown woolen tunic with simple embroidery at the collar, sturdy leather belt with a pouch for coins, and a modest cap typical of merchant-class Venetians. He stands amidst the bustling marketplace of Ruga dei Conciapelli with a ledger in one hand and a porter's hook visible behind him, symbolizing his rise from manual laborer. The stall displays contracts and manifest documents. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, with the distinctive Venetian architecture visible in the background. Nearby, porters carry merchandise while merchants negotiate, highlighting his position between social worlds. His calloused hands and alert eyes reveal both his working-class origins and his shrewd business acumen. Painted in the style of Vittore Carpaccio with realistic Renaissance details and a muted color palette of browns, blues, and earthy tones appropriate to his social station.
