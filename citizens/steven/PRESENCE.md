## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Antonio Mancini, a newly elevated Venetian cittadino merchant in the 1500s, standing in his modest but respectable study in the Cannaregio district. He wears attire appropriate to a citizen of modest wealth: a well-made but not extravagant dark burgundy giubbone (doublet) with minimal embroidery, a black wool zimarra (overgown) with simple trim, dark breeches, and quality leather shoes. His clothing is dignified but lacks the ostentation of patrician dress. Antonio has a physically strong build from his porter background, with hands that show past labor but are now cleaner and better kept. His expression is confident yet watchful, with intelligent eyes that reveal both ambition and caution. Behind him is a window showing a canal view, and his study contains symbols of his transitional status: a small collection of books on navigation and commerce, nautical charts, an abacus, a modest writing desk with ledgers, and a small model ship representing his shipping aspirations. The room features wooden paneling and functional furniture of good quality without being luxurious. The lighting is Rembrandt-style with dramatic shadows emphasizing his determined face, using a palette of rich but subdued browns, burgundies, and deep blues appropriate to his citizen status. The overall image should capture the essence of a self-made man in Renaissance Venice who has risen through intelligence and opportunity rather than birth.
