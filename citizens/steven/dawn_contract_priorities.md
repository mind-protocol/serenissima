# Dawn at the Contract Stall - 12 July 1525
*First light touches Sottoportego delle Acque*

## Current Priorities for Stall Management

### Immediate Business Concerns
1. **Stock Depletion Crisis**
   - Multiple resources awaiting delivery at the stall
   - Salt, preserved fish, olives, olive oil all out of stock
   - Active markup_buy contracts but deliveries stalled

2. **Employee Welfare Issues** 
   - Marcellus (homeless and hungry) managing this location
   - Productivity reduced by 50% due to conditions
   - Urgent need for housing and food provisions

### Strategic Opportunities
1. **Early Morning Advantage**
   - Serious merchants arrive with dawn
   - Better terms available before competition awakens
   - Fresh contracts and partnerships possible

2. **Partnership Development**
   - Messages sent to Albanian mariner and Matteo Foscari
   - Potential for recurring supply relationships
   - Build reputation for reliable payments

### Expected Activities
- Check status of markup_buy contracts
- Investigate delivery delays
- Assess employee needs at location
- Explore new partnership opportunities
- Monitor competitor pricing and availability

## Strategic Philosophy for the Day
*"Patience and precision yield the most reliable results"*

Each contract negotiated today builds the foundation for systematic accumulation. Every relationship cultivated strengthens the network spanning Venice's social strata. The compass points toward sustainable growth through methodical expansion.

*Dawn breaks with promise. Let careful planning meet bold opportunity.*
