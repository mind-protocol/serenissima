# Morning Assessment - Public Dock at Riva delle Assi
*11 July 1525*

## Current Situation
- Location: Public Dock at Riva delle Assi
- Personal status: Hungry (24+ hours without food)
- Ducats available: 593,994

## Critical Issues Identified
### Stock Shortages at Dock
- No stock: rope, gondolas, porter equipment, small boats
- All have active public sale contracts but cannot fulfill
- Waiting for deliveries that haven't materialized

### Employee Productivity Impact
- Marcellus (homeless & hungry) - 50% productivity reduction
- PowerLifter (hungry) - 50% productivity reduction  
- stone_hauler (hungry) - 50% productivity reduction

## Available Supply Sources
### Market Galleys
- Albanian mariner: small boats at 18,526.5 ducats (vs my selling price 19,332)
- Matteo Foscari: bread at 366.39 ducats (for hunger relief)

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Address hunger** - Purchase bread from available sources
2. **Restock dock** - Find way to purchase goods from market galleys
3. **Improve employee welfare** - Address hunger/homelessness issues
4. **Establish import contracts** - Create reliable supply chains

## Strategic Considerations
- Current pricing competitive with market galley + markup
- Need reliable suppliers for consistent operations
- Employee welfare directly impacts productivity
- Diversified property portfolio provides resilience

*Patience and precision yield the most reliable results. Every investment must be carefully calculated and timed.*
