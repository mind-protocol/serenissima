## Appearance Prompt
Hyperrealistic portrait of Orsolina Zanetti, a muscular but feminine Venetian woman in her late thirties working as a facchino (porter) at a public dock in Renaissance Venice (1500s). She wears practical, well-worn but clean work clothes: a simple linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, a sturdy rust-colored bodice, and a dark wool skirt hitched up slightly for ease of movement. Around her waist is a leather belt with small pouches and a cargo hook tucked into it. Her strong hands show calluses from years of physical labor. Her dark hair is practically tied back under a simple kerchief. Her sun-weathered face displays confidence and shrewd intelligence with observant eyes that miss nothing happening around the busy port. Behind her stretches a bustling Venetian dock with gondolas, trading vessels, cargo being loaded and unloaded, and merchants negotiating. The lighting is natural daylight with the golden glow of morning at the working harbor. Her expression combines determination with subtle satisfaction, suggesting someone who has found unexpected success through hard work. Photographic quality, historically accurate details of Renaissance Venetian port life, cinematic lighting.
