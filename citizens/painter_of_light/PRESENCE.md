## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic, detailed Renaissance portrait of Marco della Luce, a proud and obsessive Venetian artist in his mid-30s. He stands in a dimly lit artist's workshop; dramatic chiaroscuro lighting from a high window illuminates one side of his face, casting the other in deep shadow, reflecting his 'Lux et Umbra' philosophy. He has an intense, visionary gaze, with subtle hints of a past burn on his hand which rests near a collection of paintbrushes. He wears the fine but practical dark doublet of a successful artisan, not a nobleman. In the background, an easel holds a canvas with a work in progress, and a single, exquisite piece of Murano glass sits on a table, catching a brilliant gleam of light. The style is reminiscent of a painting by Caravaggio, capturing a mood of brooding ambition and profound artistic focus.
