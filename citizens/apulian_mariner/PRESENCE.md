## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of a prosperous 45-year-old Italian merchant in the style of Lorenzo Lotto, wearing rich burgundy velvet doublet with gold thread embroidery and fur-trimmed sleeves, white silk shirt with fine lace collar, and a black velvet cap with silver brooch. His face shows intelligence and determination with slightly graying hair and calculating dark eyes that reflect both ambition and wariness. Soft Rembrandt lighting from left side, hands resting on ornate table with ledger books, scales, and small bags of ducats. Background shows interior of prosperous warehouse with wooden shelves, amphorae, and glimpse of Venetian canal through arched window. Rich color palette with deep reds, golds, and browns befitting cittadini status.
