## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic, 4k, cinematic portrait of Lorenzo Barbaro, a wealthy 15th-century Venetian philosopher from a banking family. He is a man in his late 30s with an intense, focused expression and a hint of intellectual pride, his brow slightly furrowed in concentration. He is seated at a simple wooden table in a sparsely furnished but respectable room in a Venetian inn, a temporary 'studiolo' overlooking a canal through a gothic arch window. He wears a sober, high-quality black velvet 'zimarra' over a dark doublet. The lighting is dramatic chiaroscuro, in the style of Rembrandt, with a strong light source from the side illuminating his face, hands, and the scattered papers and open leather-bound book before him. An inkwell, a quill, and a small, heavy pouch of ducats are on the table, symbolizing his conflict between knowledge and wealth. The overall atmosphere is one of intense, solitary contemplation and slight frustration.
