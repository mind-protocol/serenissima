## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
A realistic portrait of Niccolò Bizantino, a middle-aged Mediterranean merchant sailor in 1470s Venice. His weathered face shows intelligence and wariness with tanned skin and calculating dark eyes. He wears practical but quality sailing clothes - a simple blue woolen coat over a linen shirt, with a red sash at his waist holding small merchant's tools. Around his neck hangs a pendant combining Christian and Ottoman motifs. He stands at a Venetian dock with his modest but sturdy trading galley visible behind him. The natural lighting captures the golden hour at port, illuminating his face which bears subtle signs of his mixed Venetian-Greek heritage. His expression conveys both vigilance and adaptability, as he looks slightly to the side as if assessing opportunities. Nearby are small crates of eastern goods - spices, silk, and copper items. The Venetian harbor architecture forms the background with the distinct Byzantine-Ottoman skyline visible on the distant horizon.
