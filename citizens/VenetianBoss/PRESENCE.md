## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lucia Zanchi, a wealthy female logistics entrepreneur from working-class Facchini origins. She stands confidently in her warehouse headquarters with detailed maps of Venice's canals and her color-coded ledger system visible on walls behind her. She wears practical but increasingly fine clothing—a dark wool dress with subtle silk trim and a modest but quality linen collar, indicating her risen status without aristocratic pretension. Her expression is calculating and vigilant, with eyes that constantly assess and plan. Her right hand holds her signature ledger while her left gestures toward stacked crates marked with her color-coding system. The converted salt warehouse interior shows signs of her success—quality furniture and mathematical instruments on her desk—while maintaining functional simplicity. Natural light streams through warehouse windows, illuminating her weather-worn but dignified face that shows both determination and wariness. Dock workers can be glimpsed through an arched doorway loading cargo according to her precise system. The color palette combines practical earth tones with touches of Venetian blue and the occasional flash of accounting-ledger red. Style reminiscent of Tintoretto's portraits of Venetian citizens, with realistic attention to the subject's calculated expression and the organized chaos of commerce surrounding her.
