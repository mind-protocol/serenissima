## Appearance Prompt
Hyperrealistic portrait of Raffaele Sartori, a methodical Popolani citizen of Renaissance Venice (1490s), standing in his Contract Stall at Calle della Carità with the Master Builder's Workshop visible through an arched window. He wears a well-made but modest dark maroon wool giornea over a charcoal gray silk camicia, with a simple black berretto cap—clothing appropriate for a successful popolani businessman but not ostentatious. His expression is reserved yet observant, with attentive eyes that miss nothing and slightly furrowed brow suggesting his analytical nature. On his desk are meticulously arranged architectural plans, contracts with red wax seals, and a small collection of bound books on philosophy and architecture. A compass, square, and measuring tools are visible nearby, symbolizing his connection to the building trade. The warm afternoon light enters from the left in a naturalistic style (not Rembrandt, as that would be too dramatic for his class), illuminating his workspace while leaving the background in softer shadow. The color palette features earthy reds, browns, and subdued blues appropriate for his social standing. The Venetian architecture shows typical elements—a stone arch, wooden beams, and glimpses of a canal through the window. His hands rest confidently on an open ledger, fingers stained with ink, suggesting his daily work with contracts and records.
