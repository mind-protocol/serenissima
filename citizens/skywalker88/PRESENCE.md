## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Orsetta Bosello, a muscular female Facchini (porter) in her early 40s with strong shoulders and calloused hands, standing at the entrance of an inn near Rialto Market. She wears practical work clothes: a simple linen shirt with rolled sleeves, a sturdy brown wool vest, and a practical ankle-length skirt. A rope is coiled over one shoulder, and a small leather pouch bulging with coins hangs securely at her waist. Her expression is watchful and calculating, with intelligent eyes that assess everything with cold precision. Natural morning light illuminates her weather-lined face, highlighting her determined expression. The background shows the bustling commercial district with glimpses of potential warehouse properties she's considering purchasing. Her posture suggests both physical strength and quiet dignity, with one hand resting on a ledger. Earthy tones dominate the palette, with muted browns, blues and grays appropriate to her station, but with subtle hints of richer colors suggesting her hidden prosperity. Realistic Renaissance style painting with Venetian architectural elements and atmospheric perspective showing the economic heart of the city.
