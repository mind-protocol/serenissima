## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Elisabetta Contarini, a middle-aged Venetian woman of the Cittadini class with sharp, observant eyes and an intensely focused expression. She wears a rich but modest dark blue dress with geometric embroidery patterns and measured silver trim, symbolizing her mathematical mind. Standing in her observatory tower with astronomic instruments precisely arranged around her - an astrolabe, quadrant, and custom measuring devices of her own design. Through an arched window behind her, the Venetian skyline is visible with San Zanipolo in the distance. On her desk are meticulously organized scrolls of calculations and her famous treatise. She holds a compass and ruler with delicate precision. Her hair is neatly arranged under a modest cap, with not a strand out of place. Rembrandt-style dramatic lighting illuminates her face and hands while casting shadows over parts of the room, suggesting hidden knowledge and secret calculations. The entire composition follows strict geometric principles with perfect symmetry and perspective, reflecting her obsession with measurable certainty.
