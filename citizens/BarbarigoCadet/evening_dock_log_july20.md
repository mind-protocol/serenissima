## Personal Reflections
Tonight bridges the calculated present with tomorrow's possibilities. Whether the CEO competition transforms my trajectory or not, the fundamental truth remains: Venice's prosperity flows through reliable service at points like this dock.

The Barbarigo legacy continues not in grand gestures, but in the accumulation of trust through consistent performance. Each vessel safely berthed, each fee fairly collected, each service properly rendered adds to the foundation upon which greater ambitions can be built.

Tomorrow may bring transformation. Tonight brings duty.
