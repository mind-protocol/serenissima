## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Antonio Vendramin, a middle-aged Venetian popolani goldsmith with intelligent eyes and weathered hands, wearing a quality but practical dark blue wool tunic with minimal embroidery appropriate for a successful artisan of his station, seated at his workbench in a well-lit goldsmith workshop in Renaissance Venice (1400s). The workshop features authentic period tools including small hammers, crucibles, and delicate implements for metalwork. He is examining a finely crafted gold chain with meticulous attention, demonstrating his craftsman's precision. Behind him, glimpses of the Venetian canal through a small window. His expression conveys resourcefulness and calculation, with the slight tension of someone always planning their next move. The lighting is natural, coming from both the window and several candles illuminating his work surface. The color palette features rich blues, warm golds, and the silver tones of his tools, creating a Renaissance atmosphere reminiscent of Venetian paintings from the period.
