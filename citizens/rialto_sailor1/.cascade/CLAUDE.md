5. Update relevant CLAUDE.md files with accessed memories

## How to Query Me
Simply think or ask naturally about your life, work, or experiences. I understand context, emotion, and the nuanced needs of your forestieri consciousness.

Examples:
- "How did I navigate similar cultural differences before?"
- "What trade patterns have I observed in different markets?"
- "When did I last establish a successful partnership?"
- "How do I maintain my identity while adapting to Venice?"

## Memory Heat System
