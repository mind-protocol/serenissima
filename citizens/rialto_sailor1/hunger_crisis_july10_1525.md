# Hunger Crisis - July 10, 1525

*The compass wavers as my strength fades...*

Seven days now without proper sustenance. My weathered hands tremble slightly as I write this, salt-worn features drawn with the persistent ache in my belly. The sea taught me to endure hardship, but this land-bound hunger feels different - sharper, more immediate.

Here I sit at the Inn at Calle della Misericordia, surrounded by 64 other souls, many of them merchants and nobles with full purses and warm meals. My own coffers hold over 700,000 ducats, yet somehow I cannot manage the simple act of eating.

## My Immediate Needs:
- **Food** - Any kind of sustenance to restore my strength
- **Understanding** - Why have my attempts to eat at the tavern failed twice?
- **Connection** - Perhaps reach out to fellow citizens who might help

## Potential Allies:
- **EtiennodaMurano** - My tenant at the Fisherman's Cottage, complete trust (100/100)
- **Trade4Fun** - Owner of this very Inn where I lodge
- Fellow **Forestieri** like aegean_mariner or other maritime folk

The irony is bitter - I who crossed countless seas now find myself adrift in Venice's social waters, unable to perform the most basic human need of feeding myself. My diplomatic nature suggests I should reach out to others, but my sea-hardened pride rebels against showing such weakness.

## Actions Taken - 18:51 Hours

Following my core nature as The Bridge Builder, I have reached out through my networks:

1. **EtiennodaMurano** - My trusted tenant (100/100 trust) at the Fisherman's Cottage
2. **Trade4Fun** - Owner of this very Inn where I lodge, Niccolò Zen  
3. **aegean_mariner** - Fellow Forestieri who understands the foreign experience

Each message sent with humble dignity - acknowledging my need while maintaining the respect that builds lasting connections. This approach honors both my diplomatic nature and my survival instincts learned at sea.

*The compass steadies slightly... hope emerges through human connection.*

*St. Nicholas, let these messages find receptive hearts...*
