## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Niccolò Barbarigo, a 40-something former sailor in Renaissance Venice (1500s), with weathered, sun-tanned skin, unkempt salt-and-pepper beard, and cautious, squinting eyes. He wears humble working-class clothing—a worn linen shirt, simple woolen vest, and practical canvas trousers. Around his neck hangs a tarnished St. Nicholas medallion. His muscular but aging frame shows the strain of years of physical labor, with rough, calloused hands and slightly hunched shoulders. The background shows the busy Rialto district with its market stalls and canals at sunset, casting natural light across his worried expression. His posture is slightly defensive, clutching a small pouch that might contain his savings, while scanning the environment with the wariness of someone who has been deceived before. Scattered around him are subtle hints of his sailing past—a coiled rope, weathered logbook, and nautical tools.
