## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian merchant portrait, mid-1500s, Rembrandt-style natural lighting, depicting Bernardo Navagero, a serious-looking man in his early 40s with a neatly trimmed dark beard, thoughtful brown eyes, and an observant, cautious expression. He wears the respectable but understated attire of a successful popolani merchant - a quality dark maroon wool zimarra (outer robe) over a black silk giubbone (doublet), with a modest white linen collar. His clothing is well-made but lacks aristocratic embellishments, appropriate for his social standing as a successful tradesman rather than nobility. He stands at his Contract Stall in Calle della Pasticceria, with leather-bound ledgers and a merchant's scale visible on the wooden counter beside him. In the background, glimpses of Venice's commercial district with gondolas and the distinctive Venetian architecture. His hands rest on a document bearing commercial seals, suggesting his meticulous attention to contracts and details. His expression conveys both intelligence and slight distrust, embodying someone who has risen through careful calculation rather than inherited privilege.
