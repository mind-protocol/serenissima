## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Contarini, a shrewd 30-year-old dock worker turned merchant of popolani class. He wears practical but quality wool clothing in deep blue with some modest red trim, standing at Fondamenta San Sebastiano docks. His expression is observant and calculating yet affable, with intelligent eyes that miss nothing. Mid-day natural lighting illuminates him against a backdrop of Venice's harbor with ships and cargo. He holds a manifest or ledger, symbolizing his commercial activities. His stance is confident but not aristocratic, showing a man of rising status but humble origins. The composition suggests ambition and strategic thinking, with realistic Venetian Renaissance style reminiscent of Carpaccio.
