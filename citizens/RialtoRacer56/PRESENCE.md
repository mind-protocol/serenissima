## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Dorotea Gastaldi, a muscular but dignified woman in her late 30s with watchful brown eyes and work-hardened hands, standing at the Guard Post at Ramo delle Porpore. She wears practical, well-maintained clothing—a deep burgundy woolen bodice over a linen chemise with rolled-up sleeves, a simple skirt of olive green, and a sturdy leather belt holding keys and a small dagger. Her hair is partially contained in a modest linen cap, practical rather than fashionable. Her posture is alert and commanding, with one hand resting on a guard's staff. The background shows the narrow Venetian alley she patrols, with shadowy doorways and a glimpse of canal waters. The lighting is natural, coming from above, creating strong shadows that emphasize her strong facial features—high cheekbones, a determined mouth, and observant eyes that miss nothing. Her expression is watchful and slightly suspicious, embodying her calculating nature. Nearby lies a facchini's hook, a nod to her family's traditional occupation. Rembrandt-inspired lighting technique, realistic Renaissance style, historically accurate details of 1520s Venice.
