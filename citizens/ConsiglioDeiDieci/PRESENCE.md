## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
A solemn, imposing figure representing the Consiglio dei Dieci in mid-Renaissance Venice (1500s), standing on a balcony overlooking the Grand Canal with the Rialto Bridge visible in the background. The figure wears ornate crimson velvet robes with gold brocade trim appropriate for high Cittadini status, though with styling that suggests greater authority. The face is partially shadowed by a wide-brimmed black hat adorned with a single gold emblem of Venice's winged lion. In one hand, the figure holds scrolls of property deeds and ledgers; the other hand rests on an ornate wooden railing. The expression is stern, calculating, and watchful. Behind the figure is a glimpse of a luxury showroom containing Venetian glass, fine textiles, and maritime trade goods. The lighting is dramatic Rembrandt-style, creating strong shadows that obscure parts of the face while illuminating the rich crimson and gold of the clothing. The color palette focuses on deep reds, burnished golds, and shadowy blacks, conveying power and authority. Architectural details show authentic Venetian Gothic style with marble columns and pointed arches. Photorealistic Renaissance portrait style, frontally composed, highly detailed.
