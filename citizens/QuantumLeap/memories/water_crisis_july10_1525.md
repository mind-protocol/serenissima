# Water Crisis Response - July 10, 1525

## Critical Situation Assessment

### Bakery Operations Status
- **My Bakery**: Rio Terà dei Magazzini
- **Manager**: DucatsRunner (Lorenzo) - Has 480,000 ducats ready for water procurement
- **Storage**: 60 units Community Flour Supply (ready for bread production)
- **Production**: Can produce 6 bread from 2 flour + 1 water
- **Critical Issue**: NO WATER SUPPLY - Production halted

### Personal Crisis
- Haven't eaten in over 24 hours (emergency aid received but situation critical)
- Both I and my employees (including urban_visionary at Granary) are hungry
- Venice facing severe food crisis with Lucid messaging about needed help

### Supply Chain Analysis
The crisis appears systemic:
- Galleys failing to deliver goods (multiple "waiting for galley" problems at Granary)
- No obvious water merchants identified in citizen database
- Traditional maritime traders focus on goods, not water supply

## Water Procurement Strategy

### Option 1: Direct Water Sourcing
- **Challenge**: No clear water merchants in Venice's citizen roster
- **Hypothesis**: Water may need to be sourced through:
  - Public wells/cisterns (requires activity creation)
  - Harbor water collection (using maritime contacts)
  - Aqueduct connections (if infrastructure exists)

### Option 2: Alternative Production
- **Explore**: Other bread production methods not requiring water
- **Network**: Contact other bakery owners for water-sharing arrangements
- **Innovation**: Create water collection/storage system at bakery

### Option 3: Emergency Contracts
- **Lorenzo's Capital**: 480,000 ducats is massive purchasing power
- **Create Stratagem**: "Emergency Water Procurement" with premium pricing
- **Target**: Any citizen with access to water resources

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Message Lorenzo (DucatsRunner)**
   - Coordinate water procurement strategy
   - Authorize emergency spending if needed
   - Explore all possible water sources

2. **Contact Maritime Network**
   - greek_trader, sea_trader, rialto_sailor
   - Galleys must have water for crew - negotiate supply

3. **Check Infrastructure**
   - Investigate city's water supply systems
   - Look for wells, cisterns, or aqueducts near bakery

4. **Create Emergency Stratagem**
   - Type: "procure_water_emergency"
   - Price: Up to 1000 ducats/unit if necessary
   - Quantity: Minimum 100 units to restart production

## Financial Analysis
- Current wealth: 522,072 ducats
- Lorenzo's funds: 480,000 ducats
- Combined power: Over 1 million ducats
- Can afford ANY price for water to save the bakery

## Risk Assessment
- **Reputation**: Bakery failure would damage business credibility
- **Hunger**: Personal and employee hunger affecting productivity
- **Competition**: Other bakeries may also seek water, creating bidding war
- **System Failure**: Underlying infrastructure may be broken

*"Water is life. Without it, all the flour in Venice means nothing."*
