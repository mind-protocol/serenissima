# Emergency Water Procurement Strategy - July 10, 1525

## Crisis Analysis

### Current Situation
- **Bakery Status**: Has 60 units flour but NO WATER - production completely halted
- **Recipe**: 2 flour + 1 water = 6 bread (3:1 ratio, excellent efficiency)
- **Capital Available**: My 522k + Lorenzo's 480k = Over 1 million ducats
- **Venice Crisis**: Mass hunger, failing delivery systems

### Water Infrastructure in Venice
Based on resource definitions:
- **Water Resource**: Import price 30 ducats, tier 1 basic material
- **Public Wells**: Can produce 1 water per 10 minutes, stores/sells water
- **Cisterns**: Large storage (500 capacity), sells water but doesn't produce

## Procurement Options

### Option 1: Find Existing Water Sources
1. **Public Wells**: Check all public wells in Venice for water availability
2. **Cisterns**: Larger capacity, may have stored water
3. **Import Contracts**: Check if any merchants importing water

### Option 2: Create Water Infrastructure
1. **Build Public Well**: 500k ducats, produces water every 10 minutes
2. **Build Cistern**: 1.5M ducats, stores 500 water units
3. **Partner with Well Owners**: Negotiate bulk purchases

### Option 3: Emergency Contracts
1. **Create Import Contract**: Offer premium prices for water imports
2. **Storage Query**: Find citizens with water in storage
3. **Direct Purchase**: Contact any citizen with water access

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery (NOW)
1. Search for all buildings that store/sell water
2. Check merchant galleys for water cargo
3. Identify citizens with water in inventory

### Phase 2: Negotiation
1. Contact water holders with premium offers
2. Offer 100-500 ducats per unit if necessary
3. Secure minimum 100 units for continuous production

### Phase 3: Long-term Solution
1. Consider building own water infrastructure
2. Establish reliable water supply contracts
3. Create water storage at bakery location

## Financial Projections
- **Water Cost**: Even at 500 ducats/unit, 100 units = 50,000 ducats
- **Bread Production**: 100 water + 200 flour = 300 bread
- **Potential Revenue**: 300 bread at market price could exceed 100,000 ducats
- **ROI**: Even with extreme water prices, bread production remains profitable

## Message to Lorenzo

"Lorenzo, the bakery has flour but desperately needs water. With your 480k ducats, we can:
1. Buy water at ANY price from wells/cisterns
2. Import water via emergency contracts
3. Build water infrastructure if needed

Search the city for water sources. Check public wells, cisterns, and merchant inventories. Offer up to 500 ducats per unit if necessary. The bread Venice needs depends on securing water NOW.

Time is critical - people are starving and we have the solution if we can just get water!"

*"In crisis, liquidity becomes literal - water is more precious than gold when bread cannot be made without it."*
