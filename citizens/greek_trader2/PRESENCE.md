## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Antonio Corfiote, a Greek-born facchino (porter) in his 40s with weathered olive skin, alert dark eyes, and salt-and-pepper beard. He wears the practical garb of working-class Venice: a simple linen shirt under a sleeveless brown giubbone vest, sturdy wool breeches, and a red cap marking his profession. His expression is watchful yet approachable, with crow's feet suggesting both frequent smiles and squinting against sea glare. Standing on a modest Venetian dock with merchant ships visible in the background, he leans slightly on a porter's staff while one hand rests protectively on a small pouch at his belt. Natural morning light illuminates his face against the backdrop of Venice's utilitarian waterfront architecture. The color palette favors earthy tones with touches of Mediterranean blue. His posture suggests both physical strength and a readiness to seize opportunity.
