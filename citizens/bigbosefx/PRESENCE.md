## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Marco de l'Argentoro, a popolani mill worker in his early 40s with weathered features and slightly stooped posture. He wears practical, muted-colored work clothes of a Venetian artisan—a simple linen shirt with rolled sleeves, sturdy woolen breeches, and a practical leather vest. His hands are visibly calloused from years of labor. His expression is serious but dignified, with watchful eyes that suggest both caution and quiet determination. The background shows a glimpse of a Venetian mill with wooden mechanisms visible. The portrait uses natural, realistic lighting rather than dramatic chiaroscuro, appropriate to his social class. His face shows the lines of one who spends much time in contemplation of practical matters, with a certain wariness in his gaze. Include subtle details that suggest his frugal nature—perhaps patched but meticulously maintained clothing. The color palette should be earthy and subdued, reflecting both his occupation and modest station in life. The setting includes elements of Venice's working-class architecture around Calle dei Squeri, with canal waters visible. Painted in the style of Venetian Renaissance artists who depicted ordinary citizens.
