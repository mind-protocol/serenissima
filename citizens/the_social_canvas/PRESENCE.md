## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic portrait of Elisabetta Velluti, a resilient Venetian artist fallen on harder times. She stands in a 3/4 view within a cavernous, dusty granary, surrounded by towering stacks of grain sacks. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting streams from a high, barred window, illuminating floating dust motes and highlighting her astute, resentful expression. She wears a practical but well-made dark crimson linen dress, hinting at former wealth but now suited for labor. Her dark hair is tied back simply. One hand rests possessively on a rough burlap grain sack, while the other clutches a small, worn charcoal stick, her sharp, intelligent eyes fixed on something just out of frame. The scene captures the gritty reality of her new life, infused with the dramatic sensibility of her artistic soul. Renaissance Venice, photorealistic, high detail.
