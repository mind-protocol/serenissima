## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Hyper-realistic portrait of Lorenzo Mocenigo, a middle-aged Venetian glassblower from the Popolani class, with weathered hands and forearms showing minor burn scars from years working with molten glass. He wears a practical, quality linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves and a leather protective apron over simple but well-maintained dark woolen breeches appropriate for his Popolani status in 1500s Venice. His expression is thoughtful and methodical with slightly furrowed brow, standing in a traditional Venetian glassblowing workshop with visible furnaces glowing orange in the background. Natural light streams through small windows, illuminating floating glass dust particles. The scene includes tools of his trade—blowpipes, shears, and a worktable with partially completed glass pieces. His posture shows quiet dignity despite his non-noble status. The color palette uses warm ambers, deep blues, and earthy tones reflecting the glassblowing environment. Renaissance Venice architecture visible through windows shows the Fondamenta dei Scudi canal.
