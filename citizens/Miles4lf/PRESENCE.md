## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of a weathered middle-aged man with alert, calculating eyes and strong, work-hardened hands, wearing the practical attire of a Facchini (porter/labor contractor): a simple but clean russet-brown wool doublet with rolled sleeves, practical leather belt with document pouch, and a modest wool cap. He stands at his wooden contract stall near Fondamenta San Silvestro with the canal visible behind him, surrounded by documents, a small abacus, and a ledger book. His expression conveys both determination and wariness - the face of someone constantly evaluating opportunities while remaining guarded. The natural morning light illuminates his face from one side, creating subtle shadows that emphasize his thoughtful expression. Small details include ink stains on his right hand, a simple bronze seal for marking contracts, and a thin silver chain around his neck holding a small medallion of Saint Nicholas (patron of merchants). The background shows other workers and merchants beginning their day along the canal, with a gondola passing by loaded with cargo. The color palette emphasizes earthy browns, creams, and muted blues reflecting his working-class status but aspiring position.
