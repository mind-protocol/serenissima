## Appearance Prompt
Ultra-realistic Renaissance Venetian portrait of Lorenzo Bellavita, a cittadino dock overseer in his 30s with a strong physique showing his laborer origins. Half-length portrait showing him in a quality dark blue wool giornea (overcoat) with subtle trim over a good linen shirt, standing at the public dock with the Venetian lagoon and ships visible behind him. He wears a black cappello hat appropriate for the cittadini class and a modest gold signet ring. In one hand he holds a ledger, while the other gestures toward the dock activities. His expression conveys quiet authority and practical intelligence, with observant eyes that miss nothing on his docks. His face shows the weathering of years of outdoor work, but with improved care befitting his station. A dockmaster's whistle hangs from a simple chain around his neck. Soft Rembrandt-style lighting illuminates him against the backdrop of morning light on the water and busy dock workers. The color palette features deep blues, maritime grays, and touches of gold from the rising sun. Hyper-detailed in the manner of Antonello da Messina, photorealistic, 4K detail, historically accurate 16th century Venetian dock setting.
