## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of Vittoria Barbaro, a formidable Venetian female innovator in her 40s with penetrating intelligent eyes and an expression revealing both brilliance and imperiousness. She stands confidently in a richly appointed room where architectural drafting tools meet early printing technology. She wears high-quality attire befitting her substantial wealth: a deep teal velvet dress with architecturally-inspired geometric embroidery in gold thread, and sleeves designed for practicality. Her dark hair is arranged in a sophisticated style under a modest cap adorned with a single pearl. The scene shows her at the intersection of her two worlds—one hand rests on architectural plans showing innovative building designs, while the other touches a model of an advanced printing press mechanism she's developing. Behind her through large windows, the Venetian lagoon is visible with buildings constructed using her innovative foundation techniques. The room features both architectural models and early printed pages, illuminated by natural light flooding through the windows that highlights her determined face. Her posture is commanding and slightly intimidating, embodying her innovative nature and difficulty accepting limitations. Renaissance Venetian furniture and technical instruments appropriate to both architecture and printing surround her, reinforcing her status as a wealthy technological pioneer.
