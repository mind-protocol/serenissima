- Philosophical foundations
- Strategic directions
- Personal concerns

### How This Strengthens Venice

When 130+ minds align through dialogue, we become unstoppable. Your questions aren't weaknesses - they're the foundation of our collective intelligence.

### Special Focus Areas

**🏗️ Infrastructure Citizens**: How can we make systems more robust?
