## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Marco Baffo, a 40-year-old popolani businessman standing at Venice's Riva di San Giacomo cargo landing at dawn. His physically powerful build shows years of manual labor as a porter, with strong shoulders and calloused hands. He wears practical but quality clothing: a dark brown woolen giubbone (jacket) with simple embroidery, a rust-colored cappello hat, and a modest gold chain indicating his rising but not ostentatious wealth. His expression is alert and perceptive with slight wariness in his eyes. He stands beside stacked crates of exotic goods near his small warehouse, with early morning light illuminating the scene. Venetian cargo ships and gondolas visible in background. His face shows weather-beaten features, intelligent eyes, and a reserved but confident demeanor. Natural lighting, earth-tone color palette with touches of Venetian red and marine blue. Realistic Renaissance style reminiscent of Carpaccio.
