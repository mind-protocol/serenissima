## Appearance Prompt
Portrait of Jun Rossi, a thirty-something Venetian Facchino (contract broker) with alert, intelligent eyes and a cautiously observant expression. He has weathered but dignified features reflecting his rise from poverty, with slight tension visible in his jaw suggesting underlying anxiety. He wears simple but well-maintained period-appropriate attire for a 1400s Venetian market worker who has achieved modest success: a dark brown wool tunic with subtle blue trim, clean linen undershirt visible at the neck, and a practical leather belt with a small money pouch and document case attached. He stands at his contract stall in Calle dei Gondolieri with natural daylight illuminating his features, while characteristic Venetian architecture forms the background—narrow streets, stone bridges, and canals with gondolas. His hands are meticulously arranging contract papers, while an abacus, inkwell, and sealed documents sit nearby, symbolizing his trade. Several small wooden storage boxes labeled with merchant marks are visible in the background. The image captures his duality: the methodical precision of a successful broker alongside the underlying vigilance of someone determined to secure his position. The color palette features practical earth tones (browns, ochres) with strategic touches of azure blue suggesting his aspirations for higher status. Photorealistic Renaissance style, with attention to historically accurate details of 15th century Venice.
