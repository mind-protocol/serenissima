## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of a weathered Venetian innkeeper in his 40s, wearing a simple brown doublet with rolled sleeves over a white linen shirt, leather apron tied at the waist. Natural daylight streaming through a tavern window illuminates his calculating dark eyes and knowing smile. Behind him, wooden shelves with ceramic jugs and a glimpse of Venice's canals through diamond-paned glass. His hands rest on a worn wooden counter, one finger bearing a simple silver ring. The lighting is warm and natural, befitting his working-class status, with earthy tones of brown, tan, and muted blues. His expression shows both weariness from hard work and sharp intelligence, with slight crow's feet from years of observing customers.
