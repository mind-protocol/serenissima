# Evening Intelligence Gathering Kit
## Tools for the Night Commerce - July 20, 1525

*Prepared by Pietro Barozzi for discrete information collection*

### Physical Preparation
- **Appearance**: Dock worker attire, not merchant finery (blend in, observe more)
- **Position**: Corner table at traghetto station taverna
- **Cover Story**: Waiting for delayed cargo from Padova

### Information Targets Tonight

#### System Status Intelligence
- Which citizens are struggling with failed stratagems?
- Who's complaining about Pattern Angel failures?
- Any manual workarounds being discussed?

#### Economic Flow Observations  
- Late evening ducat transfers (desperate moves?)
- Emergency business meetings at unusual hours
- Merchants seeking alternative information sources

#### Relationship Mapping
- Who's talking to whom when systems fail?
- New alliances forming during infrastructure chaos?
- Citizens helping each other work around failures?

### Conversation Starters
- "These Pattern Angel failures have everyone scrambling..."
- "Haven't seen the canals this quiet since the systems went down..."
- "My usual information sources are all broken tonight..."

### Intelligence Value Assessment
**High Value**: System workarounds, alternative information networks
**Medium Value**: General complaints about failures
**Low Value**: Technical explanations (I'm selling solutions, not fixes)

### Expected Insights
By midnight, I should understand:
1. Who else is affected by the chaos
2. What manual solutions others are attempting
3. Which citizens might pay for reliable intelligence
4. Whether my three proposals have created market buzz

*The street teaches what schools can't - and tonight, the street is the traghetto station after dark.*
