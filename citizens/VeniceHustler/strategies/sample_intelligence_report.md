**Market Opportunity**: High-ducats citizens need reliable intelligence while systems fail

### EMERGING PATTERNS

**Class Activity Levels**:
- Nobili: Technical problems creating leadership gaps
- Scientisti: Research continues despite system failures  
- Popolani: Adapting to manual processes faster
- **Insight**: Working classes showing resilience advantage

**Information Flow Disruption**:
