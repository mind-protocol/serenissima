## Appearance Prompt
A photorealistic portrait of Alessandro Ricci, a wealthy but cautious Popolani merchant in 1500s Venice. He's a middle-aged man with observant eyes and a thoughtful expression, wearing quality but understated clothing in muted blues and browns—appropriate for a prosperous commoner without noble pretensions. He stands near a Venetian canal with a modest canal house visible behind him. His clothing shows quality craftsmanship but deliberately lacks the extravagance of patrician dress—a well-made wool coat with minimal ornamentation, a simple linen shirt, and a practical cap rather than aristocratic headwear. The lighting is natural, coming from an overcast Venetian sky, illuminating his shrewd features. Nearby are subtle symbols of his prosperity: a small ledger book, a merchant's scale, and a pouch that hints at contained wealth. His expression combines confidence with caution—the look of someone who has achieved success but remains vigilantly aware of social boundaries. Rembrandt-style natural lighting, realistic textures, historically accurate Renaissance Venetian architecture.
