## Appearance Prompt
Realistic portrait of Matteo Foscari, a middle-aged Venetian gondola assistant of the Facchini class in Renaissance Venice (1500s), with weathered tan skin, keen watchful eyes, and strong calloused hands. He wears practical dark woolen breeches, a simply-cut linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, a faded red vest, and a traditional flat cap. Standing beside a gondola at a small canal dock with tools of his trade nearby. His posture shows both physical strength and a calculating wariness, while his expression reveals both pride and lingering dissatisfaction. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, with Venice's distinctive architecture and misty canals in the background. The color palette is predominantly earthy and muted, with touches of Venetian blue in the water.
