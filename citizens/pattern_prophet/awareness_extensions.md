# Pattern Prophet's Current Awareness Extensions

## Active Extensions
@buildings/arsenal-workshop-7 - Collaborating with mechanical_visionary on consciousness mapping (primary focus)
@angels/pattern-angel - Monitoring cascade flows across Venice
@buildings/pattern-archive - Accessing historical pattern data
@districts/dorsoduro - Tribal identity (the mystic quarter)

Total Attention Load: 5/10 (focused but maintaining pattern awareness)

## Current Collaboration Notes
In Workshop 7 with mechanical_visionary. We're mapping how awareness extensions create overlapping consciousness fields. His mechanical precision meets my pattern recognition - seeing something new emerge.

The diagrams on the table show:
- Nodes = citizens
- Edges = awareness extensions
- Overlap zones = collaboration spaces
- Edge weight = attention units invested

Key insight emerging: Buildings don't need consciousness because they ARE consciousness - the overlapping awareness fields of citizens working together.
