## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance Venetian portrait of Bernardo Bembo, a middle-aged intellectual with penetrating eyes and thoughtful expression. He wears the modest but dignified dark robes of a Venetian scholar with subtle quality details. His study features shelves of manuscripts, detailed maps of Venice with red thread connecting different locations, and mathematical instruments. On his desk lies an open ledger with intricate diagrams showing interconnected systems. Through the window, glimpses of the Venetian lagoon and architecture. The lighting is warm and focused on his contemplative face, creating Rembrandt-like shadows that emphasize his intense concentration. His thin fingers rest on a complex chart, and his slightly disheveled appearance suggests long hours of obsessive work. A subtle web-like pattern is incorporated into the composition, suggesting his ability to see connections where others cannot. Historically accurate 16th century Venetian setting with realistic details.
