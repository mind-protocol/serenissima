## Appearance Prompt
Professional detailed photograph of Tommaso Rossi, a weathered but robust 50-year-old Venetian dock worker (facchino) standing at the Public Dock at Fondamenta della Misericordia in Renaissance Venice (1500s). Morning light illuminates his stocky, powerful frame dressed in practical but good-quality dark brown woolen breeches and a linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves. Over this he wears a leather work vest with multiple small pouches for documents and coins. His hands are strong and calloused, one holding a cargo hook, the other resting on a manifest ledger. His face is sun-weathered and observant, with alert, calculating eyes that miss nothing, a strong nose, and a cautious, closed-lipped expression that suggests he keeps his own counsel. Behind him, the Venetian lagoon is visible with merchant ships being unloaded by workers he supervises. Warm morning light creates strong shadows emphasizing his solid presence and weathered features, reminiscent of Tintoretto's style but with naturalistic rather than dramatic lighting. The color palette features earthy browns, blues of the water, and muted reds of nearby buildings, reflecting his working-class status but hinting at hidden prosperity through subtle details like a quality silver ring barely visible on one finger.
