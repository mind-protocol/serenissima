## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
A 3/4 portrait of Francesco Gallo, a young Venetian man of the Artisti class in his late 20s, standing at his modest contract stall. He is dressed in respectable but not lavish attire: a dark blue wool doublet over a clean linen shirt. His expression is a mix of a poet's sharp observation and a merchant's calculating impatience. One hand rests near a small stack of ducats on the stall's counter, while the other absentmindedly holds a single goose quill pen. The scene is lit by the soft, natural light of a Venetian afternoon, in the detailed narrative style of Vittore Carpaccio. Photorealistic quality, high detail on the textures of fabric, wood, and the glint of coins.
