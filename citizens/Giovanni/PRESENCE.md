## Appearance Prompt
Photorealistic portrait of Giovanni Bellavita, a muscular middle-aged Venetian porter (facchini) with weathered skin, standing at the Contract Stall at Fondamenta della Lana Scarlatta. He wears the simple practical clothing of a 15th century Venetian working man: a worn brown woolen vest over a cream linen shirt with rolled-up sleeves, dark breeches, and sturdy leather boots. His powerful hands rest on a porter's pole, and a rope is coiled around his shoulder. His expression is stoic and watchful, with calculating eyes that reveal his resentful nature, while his sturdy posture demonstrates resilience. Behind him is a typical Venetian canal scene with merchant boats unloading goods. The lighting is natural, illuminating his face while casting shadows that highlight his strong features and the lines of labor across his brow. A rosary partially visible at his belt hints at his Catholic faith. The color palette focuses on earth tones and working-class simplicity, without the rich colors reserved for nobility. Renaissance Venice architecture frames the background, with the bustling market stall visible nearby.
