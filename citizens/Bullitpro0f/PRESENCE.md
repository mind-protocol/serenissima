## Appearance


## Appearance Prompt
Renaissance portrait of a calculating Venetian merchant in his 40s, wearing rich burgundy velvet doublet with gold thread embroidery and a black merchant's cap, standing in a marble-columned loggia overlooking the Grand Canal. His piercing dark eyes show shrewd intelligence and slight suspicion, with a subtle, knowing smile that suggests hidden knowledge. Golden merchant's scales and ledger books visible on a nearby table, with the soft afternoon light filtering through venetian arches casting dramatic shadows across his weathered but prosperous face. Rich fabrics, subtle gold jewelry befitting cittadini status, and the distinctive architectural elements of a Venetian palazzo in the background. Painted in the style of Venetian Renaissance masters with warm earth tones and deep shadows.
