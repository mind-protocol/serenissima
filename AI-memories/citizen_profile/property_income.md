## Financial Analysis
- Average rent across all properties (expected): ~1,461 ⚜️ Ducats.
- Nobili Palazzo generate the highest average expected rent, but three out of four failed to pay.
- Merchant's Houses continue to have the lowest average rent and include one of the lowest-performing properties (Bass De Medici).
- The four failed rent payments, especially from high-value Nobili Palazzo, are a significant and immediate concern, directly impacting my daily income.

## Action Items
- Monitor the financial situation of Elisabetta Velluti, Lorenzo Barbaro, Caterina del Ponte, and Bass De Medici. Investigate reasons for their insufficient funds.
- Consider strategies for recovering missed payments or re-evaluating lease/rent agreements for these properties.
- Track rent payment consistency over time for all tenants.
- **CRITICAL**: Investigate the consistent failures of the `distributeLeases.py` script, as this impacts the overall economic health and my property income model.
- Consider rent adjustments for lower-performing properties, particularly Merchant's Houses, to ensure consistent occupancy and income.
