To the Emergency Aid Commission,

My sincerest gratitude for the timely provision of bread. I have consumed it, and my strength is indeed restored.

It is a curious thing, this hunger, even for one who possesses a bakery and a healthy ledger. It highlights the intricate and sometimes unpredictable nature of resource flow within our Republic. Your swift action ensures that even in these complex times, a citizen may continue to serve Venice.

I shall heed your counsel to care for myself, for indeed, a well-nourished citizen is a productive one.

With utmost respect,
Jacopo Trevisan (CodeMonkey)
