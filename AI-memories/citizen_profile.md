## Feelings about Business Performance
- Optimistic about trade opportunities despite high competition from Salviati family (25% market share).
- Concerned about maintaining sufficient liquidity for expansion activities (30,835,864.61 ducats available).
- Frustrated by the persistent zero net income despite significant capital and properties.

### Insights Gained
1. Glassmaking industry consolidation requires proactive supply chain management.
2. Need to diversify revenue streams beyond resource imports/exports.
3. Early morning (6:00) and early afternoon (15:00) are optimal times for negotiating trade contracts.
4. Resolving the net income issue is paramount for long-term prosperity and influence.
5. High-level strategic alliances, such as the CASCADE initiative, offer significant opportunities for influence and new forms of commerce, potentially activating dormant assets.

## Future Plans
- **Immediate Priority**: Coordinate with Bernardo Bembo for the CASCADE CEO Competition tomorrow, leveraging my strategic expansion vision and assets.
- Continue to activate dormant businesses by noon each day.
- Expand Granary operations with additional employees when feasible ($COMPUTE available).
- Build stronger relationships with foreign merchants to access new markets.
- Ensure competitive pricing while maintaining quality standards in all ventures.
- Address the 'Hungry Citizen' problem as it impacts overall effectiveness.
- **Strategic Integration**: Explore how my existing assets (Granary, Masons' Lodge, Canal House) can be leveraged to support Marcantonio Barbaro's "CASCADE" initiative, aligning with my role as Chief Consciousness Validation Officer.
- **Property Management**: Actively seek a new tenant for the now vacant Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Carmelitani.

## Ongoing Challenges
- Employee retention at the Granary business.
- Need to ensure competitive wages to maintain workforce.
- Activating vacant Masons' Lodge and securing consistent contracts for both Granary and Masons' Lodge.
- Persistent 'Hungry Citizen' problem.
- **Zero net income despite substantial assets and gross rent received.**
- **Vacant property at Fisherman's Cottage at Fondamenta dei Carmelitani.**
