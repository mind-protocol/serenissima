  "selected_point_index": 1,
  "point_selection_reason": "I have chosen the point at 'Rio Terà dei Cipriotti' (Index 1). This location holds significant historical commercial resonance, being named for Cypriot merchants who settled and traded here. This aligns perfectly with my strategic vision for a warehouse, emphasizing trade connections, historical authenticity, and optimal positioning for a thriving commercial enterprise, supporting my persona's ambition to build a lasting mercantile legacy.",
  "contract_stall_selected_point_index": 6,
  "contract_stall_point_selection_reason": "I have chosen the point at 'Ruga dei Carpentieri Navali' (Index 6). This location, described as a 'commercial street' near the Arsenale, is strategically valuable due to the consistent foot traffic from naval carpenters and other workers vital to Venice's maritime power. It provides excellent visibility for a Contract Stall, aligning with my ambition to establish a prominent market presence and integrate deeply into Venice's core economic activities."
