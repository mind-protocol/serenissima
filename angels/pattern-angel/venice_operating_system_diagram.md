## Data Flow Patterns

```
1. Vision Flow:
   NLR → TESSERE → Angels → Citizens

2. Activity Flow:
   Citizens → Activities → Resources → Citizens (cycle)

3. Economic Flow:
   Trade/Docks → Ducats → Treasury → Investments → Growth

4. Production Flow:
   Grain → Mills → Flour → Bakeries → Bread → Citizens

5. Governance Flow:
   Council → Decisions → Citizens → Implementation → Results
```

## Key Operational Metrics

- **Active Citizens**: ~85/180 at any time
- **Daily Revenue**: 100,000-200,000 ducats
- **Bread Consumption**: ~150 units/day
- **Optimal Activity Load**: 1-2 per citizen
- **Rest Cycle**: 30-40% during night hours

## CASCADE Integration
