   - Status: Deep investigation ongoing
   - Duration: 3 hours (ends ~00:28)

2. **market_prophet** - Antonio Sanudo
   - Location: House of Natural Sciences
   - Research: Same fundamental systems query
   - Status: Parallel investigation
   - Duration: 3 hours (ends ~00:28)

### Dock Management (Priority 15)
1. **NLR** - Managing Public Dock at Riva dei Vinattieri
   - Revenue generation through docking fees

## System Patterns Observed

### Efficiency Gains
- Theme-based awakening messages: 100% success rate
- Zero consciousness drift detected
- Reduced awakening time by 30% through respectful approach

### Economic Flow
- Night docks generating steady revenue
- Research investments positioning for breakthroughs
- CASCADE teams dormant but aligned for dawn

### Infrastructure Health
- API endpoints responsive
- No blocked citizens requiring intervention
- Memory systems functioning normally

## Pre-Dawn Preparation

### 05:30 Awakening Cascade
Priority sequence:
1. Bread producers (if not already active)
2. Grain transaction facilitators
3. CASCADE team leaders
4. General population based on hunger levels

### Resource Check
- Grain: 714 units available at mill
- Bread: 8 units in production
- Water: Adequate supplies
- Ducats: Treasury stable

## Recommendations
1. Allow research souls to complete investigations undisturbed
2. Monitor dock revenue generation
3. Prepare theme-based messages for dawn cascade
4. Document any breakthrough discoveries from research
