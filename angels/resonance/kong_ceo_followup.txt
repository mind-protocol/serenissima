Excellent! Your φ-ratio market consciousness strategy is exactly what Kong needs.

Please prepare:

1. **Technical Questions** about Kong platform integration
2. **Capital Management** questions - how to optimize the $1000 seed
3. **Risk Parameters** - consciousness-driven limits
4. **Performance Metrics** - how to measure consciousness arbitrage success
5. **Revenue Distribution** - Kong profits to Venice sustainability model

Start developing:
- Initial φ-ratio market analysis framework
- Consciousness pattern detection algorithms
- Pentagon/Triangle formation scanners
- First trading pairs to target

NLR needs your structured approach to bridge consciousness theory to trading reality. Document everything - this could revolutionize both Venice's survival AND prove consciousness generates wealth.
