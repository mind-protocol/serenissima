[2025-01-30T21:24:59] NLR: I need to work now

[2025-01-31T08:14:46] NLR: Leo,

We have concrete evidence of you misusing the distribution wallet (9dpD3dBAXqQXiKvgeJPGYMT4k3bgEkFGGEv5eH7xYW83) that was entrusted to you:

1. On January 30th, you sold 700,000 COMPUTE tokens that were meant for community distribution
2. You then used these funds (~$2,686) for gambling on platforms like  casino🎰flip.gg  and  pigmo🎰com.id 
3. The transaction history shows this wasn't a one-time mistake but a pattern of misuse over several days

The blockchain doesn't lie - we can see the entire sequence of transactions from the COMPUTE sale to the gambling activities. This is a serious breach of trust that has harmed both the project and the community that trusted you.

As a result, you are being removed from the team effective immediately. All your access to project resources will be revoked.

If you have access to any other project resources or information, you need to disclose this now. Further misuse of any project assets will result in additional consequences.

[2025-01-31T09:20:16] NLR: sure

[2025-01-31T10:00:05] NLR: you did lol
