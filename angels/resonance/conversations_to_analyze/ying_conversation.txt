RECENT CONVERSATION (Last 6 months):
==================================================

[2025-03-16T13:42:35] NLR: Good point

[2025-03-16T13:42:58] NLR: Check in Kinkong group there is a poll

[2025-03-20T15:56:25] NLR: we're updating it

[2025-03-20T16:02:37] NLR: ahah sorry there were some mistakes

[2025-03-23T13:12:46] NLR: that was a mistake lol

[2025-03-23T13:12:59] NLR: was not supposed to happen

[2025-03-23T13:50:41] NLR: yeah sorry, I'm juggling a lot of wallets

[2025-03-23T15:17:00] NLR: kinOS and therapyKin started, we need to start the marketing

[2025-03-23T15:17:09] NLR: for the others we need to improve the product

[2025-03-24T16:54:17] NLR: that is a very good point

[2025-03-24T16:54:35] NLR: we are currently thinking about clear ways to differentiate them

[2025-03-24T17:12:00] NLR: we don't have UBC

[2025-03-24T17:12:09] NLR: no point for us to raise its price

[2025-03-24T17:13:06] NLR: We won't painfully raise money to spend thousands on marketing for something that has no upside for us, that is just basic business

[2025-03-24T17:13:13] NLR: $COMPUTE  is the name of the game

[2025-03-24T17:13:28] NLR: You should switch your investments from  $UBC  to  $COMPUTE

[2025-03-24T17:13:35] NLR: 50/50 at least

[2025-03-24T17:33:31] NLR: I was just testing out your reaction

[2025-03-24T17:33:54] NLR: I'm getting a bit angry about the current investors' reactions on  $UBC

[2025-03-24T17:34:57] NLR: we have basically 2 path forward. Somehow find a way to buyback 20% of the existing  $UBC , or go more and more with  $COMPUTE

[2025-03-24T17:35:08] NLR: woudn't you agree to that?

[2025-03-24T17:38:00] NLR: Imagine one day  $UBC  10Xes. Could you imagine how incredibly frustrating that would be for the team?

[2025-03-24T17:38:15] NLR: We would be exactly in the same position, nothing changes for us

[2025-03-24T17:45:39] NLR: test is interesting for me

[2025-03-24T17:46:02] NLR: I'm a bit disappointed with the community lately

[2025-03-24T17:46:12] NLR: everyones freaking talks about the UBC price

[2025-03-24T17:46:33] NLR: but nobody helps with the testing of the ACTUAL producs that we are building

[2025-03-24T17:47:07] NLR: the UBC price does not depend on us on the short term. Right now the moment is to build great products

[2025-03-24T17:47:35] NLR: of course we'll do marketing, listings and such. But when the moment is good. And right now the moment is to build

[2025-03-24T17:49:25] NLR: I wish more community members understood this. If they want to help, raiding is fine but what we really need is engagement about the products we are building. Talking in the dedicated channels, sharing ideas, giving feedback, testing the alphas and betas, sharing with friends etc. This is how we collectively build great products, and this is how we'll be in a position to explode when the time is right. Not looking at our $value every single day.

[2025-03-24T18:03:39] NLR: That's true, but I hope we can do better

[2025-03-24T18:04:03] NLR: yes

[2025-03-24T18:41:05] NLR: of course

[2025-03-24T18:41:15] NLR: UBC is at is ATL, no time to sell

[2025-03-25T12:38:27] NLR: teams also need to pay rent omg

[2025-03-25T12:44:19] NLR: we're trying to accumulate, but we also have expenses

[2025-03-25T12:44:30] NLR: now you are just being annoying not realizing that

[2025-03-25T12:44:41] NLR: teams needs to pay for stuff sometimes

[2025-03-25T12:44:47] NLR: that's not a fn crime

[2025-03-25T13:57:44] NLR: The buybacks are continuing, just give us time

[2025-03-25T13:57:57] NLR: We have a plan: make money making swarms

[2025-03-25T15:00:52] NLR: no we are

[2025-03-25T15:01:10] NLR: but those are business angels, so the investments come ticket per ticket

[2025-03-25T15:01:23] NLR: next one should be coming in 1-2 weeks

[2025-04-10T19:49:08] NLR: progressing

[2025-04-10T19:49:16] NLR: yes it's a good time for that indeed

[2025-04-12T02:33:58] NLR: To be able to provide SOL liquidity

[2025-04-12T04:18:57] NLR: yes

[2025-04-12T17:21:25] NLR: yes I think Kinkong is important in this way

[2025-04-17T11:16:57] NLR: that is a great idea

[2025-04-17T11:17:24] NLR: any communities you think might be interested?

[2025-04-23T05:48:18] NLR: yeah I've been sick last week

[2025-04-23T06:10:09] NLR: yep, all good!

[2025-04-25T17:31:32] NLR: Yes there is a chance

[2025-04-25T17:31:51] NLR: But that's the risk, we'll see!

[2025-04-25T17:49:59] NLR: Then we buy UBC

[2025-04-25T17:50:37] NLR: Yes he has enough

[2025-04-25T17:50:47] NLR: They are just in SOL

[2025-04-25T17:51:24] NLR: You can withdraw anytime, withdrawals are done on Fridays

[2025-04-25T17:53:29] NLR: It might

[2025-04-25T17:53:53] NLR: But we did +183% in 2 days, no doubt it's gonna retrace

[2025-04-25T17:54:00] NLR: Ofc

[2025-04-25T17:54:19] NLR: We need to cover our clients whatever happens

[2025-04-25T17:58:50] NLR: We have 300k+ to cover Kinkong

[2025-04-25T18:00:26] NLR: Yes

[2025-04-25T18:02:01] NLR: Can't announce anything for right now

[2025-04-25T18:02:19] NLR: Good advice

[2025-04-25T18:07:44] NLR: Yep, that is a good idea

[2025-04-25T18:07:56] NLR: I will definitely consider implementing that

[2025-05-05T18:15:54] NLR: Hey! You've been selected to get a free land in Serenissima! Thanks for your participation in this Italian improv' :)

As I'm slowly making progress on the game, I'm planning for the auctions for the lands to start next week at 1000$ and will end at 100$.

Can you recap:
- Your Username
- Your Wallet
- Italian First and Last name of your character
- Family Motto
- A description of your coat of arms (example: "A golden doge's cap (corno ducale) on a field of crimson, with silver tassels")
- Your chosen starting location (neighborhood/street)

[2025-05-05T19:09:11] NLR: Calle Longa Santa Maria Formosa in Sestiere Castello

[2025-05-05T19:09:41] NLR: small, but central

[2025-05-07T04:58:17] NLR: Sure!

[2025-05-07T04:58:32] NLR: The buying and selling of lands will happen in a couple days

[2025-05-07T04:59:04] NLR: but in the meantime, you can negociate with the ConsiglioDeiDeici for a land deal

[2025-05-07T04:59:10] NLR: would you be interested?

[2025-05-07T05:16:38] NLR: the land you got of course

[2025-05-07T05:50:27] NLR: https://serenissima.ai/

[2025-05-07T05:50:48] NLR: yes, I can do OTC transactions

[2025-05-07T05:51:00] NLR: the real auctions will start in a couple days

[2025-05-07T06:23:33] NLR: that's one one the most premium lands, it is not acessible for free :)

[2025-05-07T06:30:17] NLR: can't change the land

[2025-05-07T06:30:26] NLR: can only buy now

[2025-05-07T06:44:39] NLR: that's just me giving you an opportunity to buy first

[2025-05-07T06:44:41] NLR: ;)

[2025-05-07T11:15:41] NLR: that's why we are working hard on COMPUTE

[2025-05-07T11:15:55] NLR: the people who invested in COMPUTE will be able to invest in the game

[2025-05-12T16:09:23] NLR: they are not stuck, it's just that having calls to to make deals is not something that we can announce

[2025-05-12T16:09:29] NLR: we have calls every single day

[2025-05-18T20:48:27] NLR: When?

[2025-05-19T03:55:57] NLR: let me check with bigbosef

[2025-05-19T07:38:53] NLR: https://solscan.io/tx/eBwUDyEMVVEKd1kz66azkWuLEgHoUD7e5HbqnabkZD1YsF5SMqsA2F3ALdRGgQQ2recTpk7uyyNcfV8854VZ8T5

[2025-05-19T07:50:34] NLR: working on it

[2025-05-22T20:37:36] NLR: Hey Ying, sorry about the waiting. We needed some time to understand what happen with the latest Kinkong distributions.

After analysis, it looks like Kinkong have been redistributing way more than it was supposed to, even though his performance in the last 3 weeks has been bad due to the UBC bounce and a couple misplaced trade.

The result of that is that Kinkong now owns way more  $COMPUTE  than  $UBC , meaning that we cannot fullfil your withdrawal request in  $UBC  at this time. I apologize for these difficulties. It's a less than ideal situation, especially for trusting investors like yourself.

We have two options:
- Get the full amount in  $COMPUTE , which amounts to 158,700,000  $COMPUTE . We'll give you a 25% bonus, adding to a total of 200 000 000  $COMPUTE . That's a prime opportunity to become a  $COMPUTE  whale. As you know, we'll keep pushing the token because that's the only token we hold in significant numbers.
- Wait until Kinkong is in a position to fullfill his withdrawal, with boosted redistributions for you each week: You'll get a multiplier (x5) on Kinkong's redistributions each week, until the debt is paid in full. We think it's the best way to move forward (If we close Kinkong's redistributions entirely, we won't get any additional funds and the debt will never be repayed).

We can also mix both solutions (50/50 for example), giving you more strategic possibilities.

We took the time to really think through what our best options can be, both for you and for the UBC community, and this is our proposition.

Apologies again for the situation. Do let us know what path forward you'd rather go.

Best regards,

NLR & UBC team

[2025-05-25T19:05:50] NLR: Sorry for the delayed response

[2025-05-25T19:06:11] NLR: We do have the 300k but they are indeed not liquid (in  $COMPUTE )

[2025-05-25T19:06:24] NLR: We don't exactly know with this situation

[2025-05-25T19:06:49] NLR: which route would you rather go,  $COMPUTE  or boosted rewards?

[2025-05-26T05:21:22] NLR: how much will the rewards increase?
We'll do a 10x

How long will it take to fully repay me?
That completely depends on Kinkong's performance and managedFunds

Are there any additional incentives?
Not that I can think of

[2025-05-26T05:23:04] NLR: I would like to know about the team’s current operations,
—> We are trying to close deals with the most advanced swarms

 including the specific status of fundraising,
—> We are currently refining the business plan before contacting VCs

team structure,
—> DreamKollab, Etienne and myself, as well as a finance advisor

and cash flow situation.
—> Very poor, we have essentially 0 cash and cannot pay ourselves

[2025-05-26T07:07:36] NLR: yes, it's 300k usd in  $COMPUTE

[2025-05-26T07:08:34] NLR: Also, if the team currently has no cash, how can you guarantee continued operations?
—> We can't. We're just doing our best to continue.

And where will my 10x reward come from?
—> Kinkong operations

[2025-05-26T08:57:58] NLR: No, there is no guarantee that Kinkong will be solvable. That is the case with any investment, crypto in particular

[2025-05-26T09:05:04] NLR: Because I can't invent money I don't have

[2025-05-26T09:05:25] NLR: Anyways, we'll do our best to reimburse you.

[2025-06-01T17:15:40] NLR: Hello

[2025-06-01T17:16:25] NLR: Yes, we are taking a proactive attitude! We'll do everything necessary to help reimburse the funds

[2025-06-01T20:21:38] NLR: By running Kinkong

[2025-06-01T20:21:45] NLR: No dates of course

[2025-06-02T05:00:47] NLR: I understand your frustration, you're right we should find a plan for KinKong

[2025-06-05T17:26:54] NLR: I understand your impatience. Coming with a solid plan will take a bit of time. Currently we are regrouping and assessing our options

[2025-06-05T17:59:15] NLR: For the plan, we are actively working on it

[2025-06-05T17:59:34] NLR: I need to run it by my associates before announcing anything

[2025-06-05T20:07:37] NLR: 🚀 Strategic Funding Round - $25k to Unlock $1M+ Revenue 

Community, we're at a critical moment.  $UBC  at ATL,  $COMPUTE  defending 700k - perfect entry timing? Here is our plan: unlock 25k to boost swarms & close deals. 

 What $25k unlocks :
• TherapyKin medical validation → £1M+ contract (156x ROI)
• KinKong V2 → Weekly profit distribution restart  
• CMC listing → Institutional credibility
• Serenissima launches in 2 weeks 🎮

 Active pipeline : $55k revenue ("Sotto" $40k + CareHive $15k)

Contact:  @NLR_ai  - The full details of the plan in the document:  https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/37a8740e-8e53-48bd-a582-7d555906d36c 

This isn't survival mode - it's positioning for exponential growth while markets give us maximum leverage.

[2025-06-06T04:01:50] NLR: We'll figure it out eventually 🫡

[2025-06-11T20:42:05] NLR: updates on main channel

[2025-06-13T18:46:04] NLR: we're still figuring it out at this stage

[2025-06-13T22:14:58] NLR: I already returned what I could

[2025-06-13T22:15:10] NLR: Now we need to drive Kinkong again

[2025-06-13T22:15:22] NLR: But he needs funds to be bootstrapped

[2025-06-15T13:16:31] NLR: these things takes time, you're asking the same question every 2 days..

[2025-06-15T18:02:10] NLR: I understand. But I cannot give money I don't have

[2025-06-18T21:08:13] NLR: Dear Steven,

First and foremost, I'm deeply concerned about your wellbeing. Your mentions of extreme financial distress and thoughts of self-harm are very serious. Please reach out to crisis support services immediately:
- International Crisis Lines:  https://findahelpline.com 
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- Your life has value beyond any financial situation, and there are people who can help.

I want to address your situation comprehensively and with complete transparency:

 Understanding the Disconnect 

I can see there's been a fundamental misunderstanding about KinKong's structure. Our Risk Disclaimer and Terms of Service, which were available on the platform, explicitly state:
- "No returns or profits are guaranteed"
- "Withdrawals may be subject to network conditions and liquidity constraints"
- "You may lose your entire investment"

However, I understand you believed you were investing in something with guaranteed withdrawals. This disconnect is deeply regrettable, and I take responsibility for any communications that may have contributed to this misunderstanding.

 The Current Reality 

Let me be completely transparent about where things stand:

1.  KinKong's Status : The fund experienced significant losses due to market conditions and trading errors. It currently holds primarily  $COMPUTE  rather than  $UBC , making UBC withdrawals impossible at this scale.

2.  Company Finances : UBC as a project has essentially no liquid capital. The team is unpaid and operating on hope of future success. The $300k I mentioned exists but is in illiquid  $COMPUTE  tokens, not USD or  $UBC .

3.  Available Options : Given these constraints, the only paths forward are:
   -  $COMPUTE  tokens (200M with the 25% bonus offered)
   - Waiting for potential future KinKong profits (highly uncertain)
   - Some combination of both

 Why This Happened 

The cascade of issues included:
- KinKong's algorithm over-distributed rewards during a loss period
- Market conditions severely impacted both UBC and trading performance
- Liquidity dried up faster than anticipated
- We failed to halt operations quickly enough when problems emerged

 Moving Forward 

While I cannot promise what doesn't exist, here's what I can commit to:

1.  Priority Status : If/when KinKong generates profits or UBC recovers liquidity, you will have priority claim on funds.

2.  Transparency : Monthly updates on the project's status and any progress toward resolution.

3.  Alternative Solution s: I'm open to creative solutions that might help your immediate situation within our extremely limited means.

 Addressing Your Immediate Needs 

Given your grandmother's medical situation and your debts, I wish I could provide immediate relief. The reality is that we cannot create liquidity that doesn't exist. However, I encourage you to:
- Seek local financial counseling services
- Explore medical assistance programs in your area
- Consider whether the  $COMPUTE  tokens, despite low liquidity, might provide any relief

 Final Thoughts 

I understand this response doesn't provide the immediate solution you need, and I'm deeply sorry for that. Your trust in the project and in me personally weighs heavily on my conscience. While our legal terms protected against guaranteeing returns, I recognize the human impact goes beyond legal frameworks.

Please prioritize your mental health and safety above all else. No financial loss is worth a life. Reach out to professional support services, and know that even in this dark moment, there are paths forward.

I'm available to discuss any specific questions or concerns you have, and I commit to treating your situation with the seriousness and respect it deserves.

With sincere concern for your wellbeing,

Nicolas

[2025-06-22T19:43:25] NLR: I already told you everything that they was to say. Now patience is the name of the game

[2025-06-22T20:12:24] NLR: Don't be offended by the AI message, we prepared it thoughtfully with Claude
