[2025-02-19T20:18:52] NLR: hey, you could be an alpha tester if you want for our next thing =)

[2025-02-19T22:19:11] NLR: just test it, say how the experience is and the bugs

[2025-02-26T02:55:26] NLR: yep, sounds perfect

[2025-02-26T02:55:53] NLR: you have all the info and contacts here:  https://digitalkin.ai/contact-demo

[2025-03-01T18:02:06] NLR: I need to put some guardrails indeed

[2025-03-01T18:02:40] NLR: like conserving a decent amount of UBC and compute to be exposed to its performance

[2025-03-01T18:02:45] NLR: Need to think it through

[2025-03-09T20:02:19] NLR: Hey =)

[2025-03-09T20:07:07] NLR: good :)

[2025-03-09T20:39:57] NLR: can't register how?

[2025-03-09T21:00:46] NLR: okay! helpful feedback thanks

[2025-03-09T21:00:51] NLR: I'll let you know

[2025-03-12T05:07:23] NLR: Could you send me a ~30 min recording of you playing, on your game of choice? You can include mic audio if you want

[2025-03-13T15:17:37] NLR: we have the recording on X also

[2025-03-13T15:17:44] NLR: but you can share with derek for sure

[2025-03-13T15:19:15] NLR: oh

[2025-03-13T15:19:24] NLR: sorry got mixed up

[2025-03-13T15:19:26] NLR: awesome

[2025-03-13T15:19:43] NLR: you can send it here or WeTransfer

[2025-03-13T15:20:39] NLR: Would you be up for a call about DuoGaming? I'm unsure what people expect / want to use it for

[2025-03-13T15:20:44] NLR: I need more feedback :)

[2025-03-13T15:21:15] NLR: basically the idea is to run DuoAI on the recording

[2025-03-13T15:21:21] NLR: See what he would have said

[2025-03-13T15:21:49] NLR: but I'm wondering if people are looking for advice / nice chatter / infos about the game / critic / etc

[2025-03-13T20:47:54] NLR: will you be able to join the DuoAI space in 15 mins?

[2025-03-15T22:29:56] NLR: hey!

[2025-03-15T22:31:44] NLR: Here is an .exe file that should be able to run DuoAI, let me know if it works!

[2025-03-17T18:56:00] NLR: dammit

[2025-03-17T18:56:08] NLR: I'll wait for store release

[2025-03-19T17:34:38] NLR: okay it's live on Windows store!

[2025-03-19T17:34:43] NLR: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NCXZN550LKZ?hl=neutral&gl=FR&ocid=pdpshare

[2025-03-19T17:41:38] NLR: awesome! the click bug might be annoying (fixed that in the next version that is already submitted)

[2025-03-19T18:11:27] NLR: Yeah the learning code is untested so probably not working

[2025-03-19T18:11:45] NLR: It should be able to capture the screen though

I won't answer here. To contact me, you can engage with:  @nlr_ai_bot

[2025-04-27T09:13:46] NLR: In the meantime, come and join the fun on our Main channel!  https://t.me/ubc_portal

[2025-04-27T18:45:48] NLR: it would be similar, with a bonding curve buyable in COMPUTE

[2025-05-05T18:13:38] NLR: Hey! You've been selected to get a free land in Serenissima! Thanks for your participation in this Italian improv' :)

As I'm slowly making progress on the game, I'm planning for the auctions for the lands to start next week at 1000$ and will end at 100$.

Can you recap:
- Your Username
- Your Wallet
- Italian First and Last name of your character
- Family Motto
- A description of your coat of arms (example: "A golden doge's cap (corno ducale) on a field of crimson, with silver tassels")
- Your chosen starting location (neighborhood/street)

[2025-05-05T19:40:31] NLR: 

[2025-05-07T05:56:43] NLR: The very first version is here!

 https://serenissima.ai/ 

The buying and selling of lands is not functional yet, but you can start to explore the map and see which lands have the highest daily income.

The income is simulated in this first phase, as soon as buildings are here the income will come from the renting of the building on top of your land!

[2025-05-07T11:44:30] NLR: thanks

[2025-05-07T11:44:48] NLR: can you refresh the page (I fixed this bug like 30 minutes ago)

[2025-05-07T11:45:12] NLR: ahah I can see that you are rich ^^

[2025-05-07T11:46:31] NLR: on it as we speak

[2025-05-07T11:46:43] NLR: thanks for being honest!

[2025-05-07T11:47:49] NLR: yeah I tried to fix it asap but did not account for people that did not refresh their browser

[2025-05-07T11:49:07] NLR: refresh your browser and let me know

[2025-05-07T11:50:17] NLR: perfect

[2025-05-07T11:50:29] NLR: (now I'm working on actually making it work)

[2025-05-07T11:51:11] NLR: yes, you can do it now

[2025-05-07T11:53:12] NLR: yes

[2025-05-07T11:54:19] NLR: I credited you 10k COMPUTE as a finders fee

[2025-05-07T11:56:08] NLR: It is many thanks

[2025-05-07T16:33:27] NLR: Hey, I love your questions don't worry

[2025-05-07T16:33:55] NLR: Actually I'm going to put the prices back up

[2025-05-07T16:33:59] NLR: Already did

[2025-05-07T16:34:18] NLR: And yes I agree the income needs to be aligned with the price

[2025-05-07T16:35:08] NLR: I like to work things out as I go, and make mistakes

[2025-05-07T16:35:23] NLR: We could do a dry run

[2025-05-07T16:35:40] NLR: But it would be less real, and more importantly less fun

[2025-05-07T16:36:38] NLR: This project is not intended to make money, but to give liquidity to compute

[2025-05-07T16:39:52] NLR: No, as people want to get ahead of the competition by buying buildings for example

[2025-05-07T18:06:24] NLR: Produce resources

[2025-05-07T18:06:40] NLR: Yes exactly

[2025-05-07T18:08:02] NLR: As a player, you make money by turning resources into better resources and selling them (running the business)

[2025-05-07T19:17:42] NLR: The final layer is citizens (. Citizen buy the finished resources. They also pay rent, but of course you have to pay their wages

[2025-05-07T19:18:16] NLR: Basically the end of the economic loop is AI, and then it circulates back to the players and that creates an economy

[2025-05-07T20:07:25] NLR: I actually only use Claude with Aider (no game framework)

[2025-05-07T20:07:37] NLR: Game development or game design?

[2025-05-07T20:19:35] NLR: https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK

[2025-05-10T23:38:11] NLR: is it clearer with the explanations or do you have questions still?

[2025-05-22T22:18:09] NLR: Actually yes! Reading the articles on Serenissima, giving feedback about what is understandable or not, and telling me what building you'd build based on what you see on the  map

[2025-05-29T22:27:38] NLR: which one?

[2025-05-30T00:09:15] NLR: fixed it!

[2025-05-30T00:09:22] NLR: not sure what happened
