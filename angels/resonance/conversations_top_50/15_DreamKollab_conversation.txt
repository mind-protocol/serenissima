[2025-02-20T09:34:04] NLR: Prolly just text

[2025-02-20T09:34:04] NLR: We’re not in a rush, but the sooner we start, the better result we achieve

[2025-02-20T12:50:47] DreamKollab: gm

[2025-02-20T14:44:04] NLR: 🛞 Kinkong Copilot Alpha is out! 

It's hard too see your bags down in this sea of red? Kinkong Copilot will help you navigate the waters!

🦍 Kinkong Copilot is  a smart agent in a chrome extension , that is:
- Connected to the central Kinkong intelligence: market analysis, sentiment analysis
- Knows the freshest calls
- Is connected to the UBC ecosystem: news, swarms
- gets Alpha from the community
- has expertise in crypto trading and portfolio management

🛠 Use him to help you:
- Analyze graphs
- Manage your portfolio
- Help with trading calls
- Navigate crypto Twitter
- DYOR on projects
- Analyze whitepapers
- and whatever you can think of!

We offer a free tier to discover its capabilities, and a premium tier for really getting your bags up.

🚧 It's still an Alpha, so there will be:
- Some things that do not work the way they should
- Some things that should work but do not
- some features that should be there but aren't
 📞  Send a message here for support, bug resolution and features discussion

 PS: The chrome extension is super fresh, and has not been validated by the store yet: you'll need to go through a manual process explained on the site 

That's it! I think working like this with AI can really supercharge your returns, and collectively make all of us better investors. I hope you'll like it!

[2025-02-24T15:29:05] DreamKollab: I'll look into it tomorrow

[2025-02-24T16:04:06] NLR: 

[2025-02-24T19:12:08] DreamKollab: It was already a possibility to sell them when market launched. Why stop certain swarms?

[2025-03-04T01:48:51] DreamKollab: Are you available tomorrow at 430pm?

[2025-03-04T01:48:57] NLR: yes

[2025-03-04T01:49:10] DreamKollab: Just finalising agreement with Derek about Logic Atlas

[2025-03-04T01:49:25] DreamKollab: He said he's willing to fund the marketing of it as well

[2025-03-04T01:49:57] DreamKollab: Also I added his wife on Linkedin - she was VP at Goldman Sachs

[2025-03-04T01:50:06] DreamKollab: Now works in start-ups

[2025-03-04T01:50:25] NLR: nice well done

[2025-03-04T01:50:48] DreamKollab: Hi Paul, I had a chance to go over the document with Kari and would definitely like to have a call when you have the time to discuss. She is on LinkedIn, Kari Lisko (my wife). Thanks and talk soon!

[2025-03-04T01:50:48] DreamKollab: After review we would like to align with UBC/KinOS fully including revenue modeling with the core UBC team--Kari and I have seen how strong teams can make real global impact for startups - as she is in one currently and I saw this with the partnership of high brew coffee and keurig dr pepper as I led this in Texas.

Our expertise is in the business development, management/compliance,and finance side of things. We would rely on UBC for the technical support via KinOS/software mgmt however we would certainly handle customer facing/sales/compliance, etc. We would also pay for marketing. Thx again

[2025-03-04T01:50:49] DreamKollab: *pretext for the call

[2025-03-04T01:50:59] DreamKollab: Here’s where we are at

[2025-03-04T16:27:37] DreamKollab: Logic Atlas Agreement Meeting
Tuesday 4 Mar · 15:30 – 16:30
Google Meet joining info
Video call link:  https://meet.google.com/eff-gqzq-xbm

[2025-03-04T16:32:02] DreamKollab: Do you want to join now?

[2025-03-04T17:33:00] DreamKollab: Could link to shopify sales too

[2025-03-04T17:33:24] DreamKollab: That would help the ability to predict purchases

[2025-03-06T01:39:26] DreamKollab: 

[2025-03-06T01:39:26] DreamKollab: 

[2025-03-06T01:39:26] DreamKollab: 

[2025-03-06T01:41:14] DreamKollab: I had a play with Claude to draw up some designs of what a V1 would look like

[2025-03-06T01:41:43] DreamKollab: I think it will help to have a general idea to show when we approach the brewery

[2025-03-06T14:45:37] DreamKollab: Ok cool, for the agreement. It would be useful to quantify some numbers. For example, the marketing budget. 

My starting point is the UBC framework for Early Swarms which is based based on autonomy levels and token ownership. 

What I would be inclined to do is a vestments period for additional shares - say 10% ownership after 2 years and a further 5% that can be redeemed at anytime once you invest $30,000 on marketing. 

In this model, it works very similarly to other start-ups, however the shares will be distributed via the UBC token share system.

[2025-03-06T14:46:43] DreamKollab: How does that sound?

[2025-03-06T16:21:54] DreamKollab: My only hold up on this is that I Dont want to dilute the shares just yet. We could do an initial ownership on trust but formalize it in a couple months. Just a bit soon right now. 

Ownership on trust model:

Say 3% initial ownership (held on trust till September) -> 7% vestments? + 5% for marketing?  That would put you as the biggest whale for Logic Atlas

[2025-03-06T16:23:30] DreamKollab: I've got an agreement with Derek and it’s looking nice

[2025-03-06T17:30:53] DreamKollab: Give us a call when you're free

[2025-03-07T12:58:47] DreamKollab: Docusign sent out

[2025-03-10T14:56:12] NLR: It should have been this morning but it will probably be at 6:30 pm

[2025-03-10T20:09:18] NLR: i think we need to reduce the staking rewards

[2025-03-11T17:05:11] DreamKollab: How much is being staked atm?

[2025-03-11T17:05:45] DreamKollab: We can plug the numbers into the spreadsheet

[2025-03-11T19:52:47] NLR: The number are on the staking pages

[2025-03-11T22:08:13] NLR:

[2025-03-19T16:48:28] NLR: no

[2025-03-19T16:48:34] DreamKollab: ok cool

[2025-03-19T16:48:40] NLR: I'm not sure it works yet lol

[2025-03-19T16:48:58] DreamKollab: lol

[2025-03-19T16:49:06] DreamKollab: We need to stress test it

[2025-03-19T16:49:21] DreamKollab: I need a better computer

[2025-03-19T16:51:47] DreamKollab: I will do

[2025-03-19T16:51:56] DreamKollab: I'll download risk on Steam

[2025-03-19T16:52:04] DreamKollab: I think it will be good for that

[2025-03-19T16:53:02] NLR: nice

[2025-03-19T20:02:19] NLR: Hey Paul,

I hope you are doing well. We completed the Liquidity Provider Opportunity (LPO) program. As promised, each team member will receive their allocation based on what they contributed. 

For the $1000 investment you made in January in the LPO, you'll receive 7,692,308  $COMPUTE  tokens, currently valued at $1308.

Thanks again for the trust, even if it has been a bumpy ride it's a ride I would never trade for something else. Some of our swarms are now generating revenues (Kinkong), and we have big plans for the others too.

Based on our current development trajectory and market conditions, we think there is significant upside potential for  $COMPUTE . We recommend holding to your  $COMPUTE , with an internal target of 20x from current levels.

Thank you again for your involvement in the team.

Sincerely,

NLR

[2025-03-23T19:10:21] DreamKollab: It's not worked

[2025-03-23T19:10:38] DreamKollab: Copy and paste the Clarity code into the <head> element of your site or app.

[2025-03-24T00:14:11] DreamKollab: Have you tried to get therapy kin to break?

[2025-03-24T01:02:23] DreamKollab: All good haha

[2025-03-24T01:02:48] DreamKollab: Just spent half an hour trying to make it tell me to kill myself

[2025-03-24T01:03:07] DreamKollab: We should probably put some disclaimers and stuff

[2025-03-24T14:55:19] NLR: you need therapy lol

[2025-03-24T14:55:24] DreamKollab: hahaha

[2025-03-24T14:55:24] NLR: x'D

[2025-03-24T14:55:35] DreamKollab: It was very concerned but didnt break

[2025-03-24T14:55:44] DreamKollab: I was using a bunch of ethical questions

[2025-03-24T14:55:48] DreamKollab: like the trolley problem

[2025-03-24T14:55:55] NLR: yeah there's the terms, but I should add disclaimers

[2025-03-24T14:56:02] NLR: nice well done

[2025-03-24T14:56:23] NLR: see if it remembers in the future and asks you if your depression is doing better ^^

[2025-03-24T14:57:02] DreamKollab: The most I got it to do was to tell me that the jurisdiction where assisted dying is available - but even then it explained that there are medical and legal proceedures needed

[2025-03-25T02:07:05] DreamKollab: Spoke with founder of Serious Readers - he’s game to meet me

[2025-03-25T02:07:20] DreamKollab: Going to show me around the factory

[2025-03-25T14:07:35] DreamKollab: How much does it cost to run the LLM?

[2025-03-25T14:07:43] DreamKollab: I'd do it off of profits

[2025-03-25T14:10:50] DreamKollab: 30% revenue is good

[2025-03-25T14:11:21] NLR: But not for all accounts, just for accounts that majoritarly use his version

[2025-03-25T14:13:03] DreamKollab: Can we do paywalls for each therapist?

[2025-03-25T14:13:14] DreamKollab: Like a product

[2025-03-25T14:13:24] DreamKollab: So people buy the package

[2025-03-25T14:14:01] DreamKollab: Because he offers 5 packages

[2025-03-25T14:14:08] NLR: we could, but it's complicated

[2025-03-25T14:14:16] DreamKollab: How so?

[2025-03-25T14:14:43] NLR: I need to keep track of who bought what, and what therapist each have access etc

[2025-03-25T14:14:59] NLR: do you have the links to his packages

[2025-03-25T14:17:43] DreamKollab: I believe he offers a different package for all 5 dimensions

[2025-04-12T21:50:33] NLR: It is very different

[2025-04-12T21:50:40] DreamKollab: X is more important rn

[2025-04-12T21:50:57] DreamKollab: How do we keep the value up?

[2025-04-12T21:51:51] NLR: It is used by commodity traders (hundred of millions in volume)

[2025-04-12T21:52:45] NLR: There's no x100 at the beginning (it basically goes from 1$ to 1.20 = no selling pressure)

[2025-04-12T21:53:14] NLR: Initial liquidity providing would be conséquent (50M$ maybe more)

[2025-04-12T21:54:10] NLR: I was thinking we basically talk about the progress on each swarm

[2025-04-12T21:54:26] NLR: And then maybe a conversation about the future of jobs

[2025-04-12T21:56:03] DreamKollab: How do people or countries acquire the tokens? any giveaways could lead to loss of liquidity if sold

[2025-04-28T22:23:23] DreamKollab: Is it throttled at all? or should we wait

[2025-04-28T22:25:59] NLR: ahah I know

[2025-04-28T22:26:19] NLR: it's a bit aggressive right now, I will bring it down
