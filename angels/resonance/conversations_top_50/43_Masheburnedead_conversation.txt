==================================================

[2025-01-25T04:02:50] Masheburnedead: Hi Lester, are some of the swarms open for public use? Like us non-coders. Or has a subscription model running already

[2025-01-25T04:06:07] Masheburnedead: I did read some swarms have a subscription model in place once they are launched

[2025-01-25T04:07:00] Masheburnedead: Very exciting and would love to even host AMAs to feature these swarms

[2025-01-25T04:07:31] Masheburnedead: I used to host and create content btw apart from banking and finance

[2025-01-25T04:16:22] Masheburnedead: I forwarded some of my previous works to Anthony and in ur own time we can see if there are collaboration opportunities.

[2025-01-27T16:41:14] NLR: Yes. Digitalkin swarm has a subscription model

[2025-01-27T16:41:31] NLR: Lets have a call about this

[2025-01-27T16:42:40] NLR: https://calendly.com/nlrai

[2025-01-27T16:43:02] NLR: Forward to me too

[2025-01-27T16:44:54] Masheburnedead: This week is CNY and will be back to Singapore this Saturday. Setting up a call with Paul on Monday so Tuesday onwards should be good.

Interview with David Kao, Binance Singapore Head

[2025-01-27T16:49:58] Masheburnedead: These were all done when i was running my own marketing company which has since closed down but experience is still there if your looking for a host to cover AMAs to feature Swarm leaders or Teams on X

[2025-01-27T17:05:48] Masheburnedead: This goes to someone else

[2025-01-27T17:05:57] Masheburnedead: Lavanya Rai

[2025-01-27T17:18:11] Masheburnedead: 

[2025-01-29T16:32:19] Masheburnedead: Hi Nicolas, i noticed that you can also conducts Lives on CMC if you have an account much like X

[2025-01-29T16:33:25] Masheburnedead: I mentioned it to Nico and the team can cross pollinate ur X posts there as well as host lives there too.

[2025-01-29T16:33:30] Masheburnedead: 

[2025-01-29T16:33:30] Masheburnedead: 

[2025-01-29T16:33:50] Masheburnedead: Very good coverage especially engaging the main CMC host

[2025-01-29T16:34:08] Masheburnedead: Sometimes i feel it is better than engaging crypto youtubers

[2025-02-03T12:02:21] Masheburnedead: whenever you are ready you can promote me to admin/mod

[2025-02-03T12:07:04] Masheburnedead: if you need me to look thru the deck that came from Victus Global, i could assist as well to make sure the terms are favorable

[2025-02-03T13:14:32] Masheburnedead: Had a chat with Alifer, i like his writing style. He could also assist with a consist thread push for UBC. Also curious who does the threads now for main X acct.

[2025-02-03T13:26:40] Masheburnedead: There also has to be emphasis on the chinese market. I am not sure if u have a mod that is reliable to assist with translation

[2025-02-03T13:34:17] Masheburnedead: Aside frm Swarm investing eventually, the Swarms can have the ability to sell their API to the users as well. Not just clients they existingly work with. This feeds the ecosystem as well and need not list in another API market place outside of the UBC ecosystem

[2025-02-03T14:19:38] NLR: great idea

[2025-02-04T02:14:41] Masheburnedead: Would you feel it is good time to feature the sold out swarms? It is a way of also thanking the community for the support for a successful launch

[2025-02-04T02:15:18] Masheburnedead: This sets the tone and builds loyalty as well

[2025-02-04T04:32:58] Masheburnedead: Hope we can jump on our call today to discuss a fair remuneration paid in UBC. I am open to varying terms and scope of work coz i am align with the objectives.

[2025-02-04T04:33:26] Masheburnedead: I get excited to work on start up projects. Makes me feel alive

[2025-02-04T04:36:58] Masheburnedead: What immediately comes to mind is a strategic advisor covering finance, hosting and comm management.

[2025-02-04T04:37:45] Masheburnedead: Appreciate your thoughts on this.

[2025-02-04T14:17:15] NLR: hello!

[2025-02-04T14:18:25] NLR: you here?

[2025-02-04T14:20:51] NLR: what about an X Space

[2025-02-04T14:20:53] Masheburnedead: Yes i am

[2025-02-04T14:21:24] Masheburnedead: Do you mean featuring them on Xspaces. Sure.

[2025-02-04T14:21:31] Masheburnedead: Bigger audience

[2025-02-04T14:22:18] NLR: have a call in 10, but what a bout later?

[2025-02-04T14:22:53] Masheburnedead: Ok sure.

[2025-02-04T14:22:58] Masheburnedead: Just adjust the meet

[2025-02-04T15:17:23] Masheburnedead: Ready when u are

[2025-02-04T15:42:36] NLR: Victus Capital

[2025-02-04T17:06:25] Masheburnedead: Lester, they invested in hedera hashgraph

[2025-02-04T17:06:52] Masheburnedead: And they conduct spaces weekly

[2025-02-04T17:10:41] Masheburnedead: if this deal goes thru it looks like you need to find some way to acquire more tokens as they are expecting you to provide USD700k worth from ur own supply

[2025-02-04T17:11:18] Masheburnedead: so it is a 30% discount and they will provide assistance to marketing making, marketing and even listing on CEX

[2025-02-04T17:12:44] Masheburnedead: or they are buying from the open market

[2025-02-04T17:12:48] Masheburnedead: we can ask later

[2025-02-04T18:00:45] NLR: https://meet.google.com/wcz-byed-efy?authuser=0

[2025-02-04T18:01:25] NLR: debrief

[2025-02-04T18:02:06] Masheburnedead: yeah i am waiting

[2025-02-04T23:28:05] Masheburnedead: It was a pleasure speaking with you too. I am looking forward to meeting more of your team soon.

Firstly, here is the information required for the contract:

Company Name:   Nicolas Reynolds
Company Address:   60 rue des Aqueducs, 69005 Lyon FRANCE
Contact Name:     Nicolas Reynolds
Contact Title:     CEO
Email:        reynolds.nicorr@gmail.com 

The company is registered under your personal name and not as UBC?

[2025-02-04T23:28:58] Masheburnedead: My suggestion is to set up a pvt limited company asap

[2025-02-05T00:12:53] Masheburnedead: Main focus is to clear KYC and discuss the terms with Victus. 

Immediate thoughts that come to mind are:

1) Team allocation requirements 30k. 
2) Token buyback schedule and ratio Compute:UBC
3) OTC or Open mkt buys. Which approach is best 
4) Setting up MM requirements for 2 tokens
5) Marketing assistance

[2025-02-05T02:07:34] Masheburnedead: Would 30k be enough and do you have additional hires

[2025-02-05T02:07:54] Masheburnedead: roles that you feel are essential

[2025-02-05T02:08:20] NLR: market buys is the only possible because we can't OTC UBC

[2025-02-05T02:08:31] NLR: I think so yes

[2025-02-05T02:08:43] NLR: no additional hires for right now

[2025-02-05T02:08:49] Masheburnedead: ok noted

[2025-02-05T02:10:48] Masheburnedead: will be enquiring the market making strategies with Victus

[2025-02-05T02:12:27] Masheburnedead: i feel that to stabilize the price of Compute it cannot be SOL but an actual stablecoin like USDC

[2025-02-05T02:12:52] Masheburnedead: will try to see if we can work out a loan arrangement with profitsharing

[2025-02-05T02:13:48] Masheburnedead: also the sales for swarms is critical or else we will end up owing more than we can bear

[2025-02-05T02:14:24] Masheburnedead: it is late for u now but if we can do a quick call once ur rested would be good on how to push for revenue

[2025-02-05T08:47:22] Masheburnedead: 

[2025-02-05T08:48:18] Masheburnedead: This is cool. Wonder if we can understand what they are discussing

[2025-02-05T08:49:57] Masheburnedead: If you can provide a demo of this in real time i am sure it will be valuable for the project. I know u did one with writing a book. But this is a demo to show that the current ecosystem of swarms are speaking to each other.

[2025-02-05T08:50:40] Masheburnedead: You can time it before/after the announcement of our partnership with Victus

[2025-02-05T10:28:59] Masheburnedead: Hi NLR, do we have a fraud prevention Agent?

[2025-02-05T10:29:09] Masheburnedead: i dont see it and thought it might be useful

[2025-02-05T10:29:18] Masheburnedead: if so, i would like to apply to be a leader in that

[2025-02-05T13:15:00] Masheburnedead: Hey Lester, we need to finalize this deal.

[2025-02-05T13:37:30] Masheburnedead: Also discussing MM options with Thanos which thankfully u know

[2025-02-05T13:37:48] Masheburnedead: So working out some favorable arrangements for UBc

[2025-02-05T13:50:54] Masheburnedead: Kindly look through Victus chat regarding token options. If we go ahead with 70/30, they will reduce the investment amt as well

[2025-02-05T13:56:46] Masheburnedead: this would be better as it helps you retain some UBC tokens and gradually acquire more as the project progresses

[2025-02-05T13:56:59] Masheburnedead: it also provides the immediate funding necessary

[2025-02-05T13:58:16] Masheburnedead: i am wondering if the balance of 300k is to assist with MM for Compute.

[2025-02-05T13:59:24] NLR: yes you can see th chats if you click on the collaboration cards

[2025-02-05T13:59:55] NLR: yes that's the plan (it's not real-time yet, working on it)

[2025-02-05T14:00:36] NLR: nice, can you fill the form in  swarms.univarsalbasiccompute.ai/lead

[2025-02-05T14:01:34] Masheburnedead: will focus on closing our deal with Victus deal so further incentive to push out quality swarms

[2025-02-05T14:01:37] NLR: what do you mean by retain some UBC tokens

[2025-02-05T14:01:44] Masheburnedead: don't want to get distracted now

[2025-02-05T14:02:18] Masheburnedead: from my understanding if you sell off ur allocations now, u are selling at the bottom of the market

[2025-02-05T14:02:32] Masheburnedead: hence i asked for 70/30

[2025-02-05T14:02:52] Masheburnedead: rather than 100% UBC which not favorable for u

[2025-02-05T14:03:07] Masheburnedead: actually i suck at text can we do a call?

[2025-02-05T14:04:34] NLR: https://meet.google.com/hyz-jrew-kdj4

[2025-02-05T14:05:55] Masheburnedead: it does not allow me to join

[2025-02-05T14:06:05] Masheburnedead: keeps saying need to enter the right code

[2025-02-05T14:18:36] NLR: Only thing I can see there that we can do is market making. If you get listed on a lower cex we can do otc as well, ascendex for example

[2025-02-05T16:06:33] Masheburnedead: There is one way. Which is every team member buys enough to benefit from this pump but it does not assure that core team will stay coz there is no payroll and they would have to risk buying up UBC with their own funds

[2025-02-05T16:06:46] Masheburnedead: This includes urself

[2025-02-05T16:07:08] Masheburnedead: Coz once the partnership is announced it will create a positive ripple

[2025-02-05T16:08:12] Masheburnedead: So we can still proceed with the deal but potentially there may be no loyalty from the core team. I am fine to stick this thru. My UBC is staked anyway

[2025-02-05T16:10:06] Masheburnedead: There is no easy decision. Just which is best path forward

[2025-02-05T16:12:08] Masheburnedead: Basically, u look like a hero but u are moving forward without an immediate payout

[2025-02-05T23:17:13] NLR: how do we pay for the UBC?

[2025-02-05T23:35:29] Masheburnedead: Exactly i am asking

[2025-02-05T23:35:59] Masheburnedead: They buy 5k worth of UBC and then we still have to give 22% bonus based on the amt. This is what i am understand

[2025-02-05T23:37:43] NLR: yes

[2025-02-05T23:38:01] NLR: but when do we get the SOL if they do that?

[2025-02-05T23:39:07] Masheburnedead: U get it daily

[2025-02-05T23:39:27] Masheburnedead: This only works if u do a wallet to wallet

[2025-02-05T23:39:37] Masheburnedead: U dont get it, if they market buy

[2025-02-05T23:40:00] Masheburnedead: Not only that, u still have to give them 22%

[2025-02-05T23:40:35] NLR: bad

[2025-02-05T23:40:40] Masheburnedead: Exactly

[2025-02-05T23:44:43] Masheburnedead: Bro, this deal is like wtf

[2025-02-05T23:45:03] Masheburnedead: U would have to held like 50% of ur tokens or something

[2025-02-05T23:47:13] Masheburnedead: This is what u understand too right?

[2025-02-05T23:47:48] Masheburnedead: They would own probably 42% of the tokens based on current market price or more

[2025-02-05T23:48:03] Masheburnedead: Total circulating.

[2025-02-05T23:49:07] NLR: crazy

[2025-02-05T23:49:29] Masheburnedead: So even if they create a pump and decide to dump we will be screwed

[2025-02-05T23:49:45] Masheburnedead: Especially after committing the funds to hiring a team, etc

[2025-02-05T23:49:50] Masheburnedead: We would be in debt

[2025-02-05T23:49:59] Masheburnedead: Not good

[2025-02-05T23:57:09] NLR: yes, OTC compute is our solution

[2025-02-06T00:02:21] Masheburnedead: Could you explain?

[2025-02-06T00:03:02] NLR: we ask for 300k, paid at 22% premium OTC in  $COMPUTE

[2025-02-06T00:03:46] Masheburnedead: Which service provider?

[2025-02-06T00:04:02] Masheburnedead: Victus?

[2025-02-06T00:06:51] Masheburnedead: So this is the counter proposal

[2025-02-06T00:09:35] Masheburnedead: Shall we counter propose and see their reaction?

[2025-02-06T01:59:30] Masheburnedead: Compute just got nuked

[2025-02-06T01:59:40] Masheburnedead: What happened?

[2025-02-06T03:39:52] Masheburnedead: Nice move

[2025-02-14T09:13:09] Masheburnedead: Hopefully this will benefit EU AI companies like Digitalkin

[2025-02-14T09:13:46] Masheburnedead: It states specifically for AI integration for industries which is what Digitalkin does.

[2025-02-14T16:50:30] NLR: yep, DigitalKin is on it
