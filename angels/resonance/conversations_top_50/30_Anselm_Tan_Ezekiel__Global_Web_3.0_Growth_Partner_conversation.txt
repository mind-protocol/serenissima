Let us know! There are only 5 slots available on a first-come, first-served basis. Thank you!

Market Overview and Collaboration Opportunities

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility. The global market cap has dropped 5.8% to $2.73 trillion, with a daily trading volume of $182 billion. Major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have seen notable declines. This environment underscores the importance of strategic partnerships and innovative solutions.

Key Insights:

Bitcoin’s SOPR: Entered loss territory, signaling potential distress selling but also opportunities for re-accumulation.

BTC and ETH Options: $3 billion in options expired, contributing to volatility and significant realized losses ($818 million/day).

CleanSpark: Included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, showing crypto-related companies gaining recognition.

Rome Protocol and KiiChain: Partnering in LATAM to drive innovation in Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and PayFi.
