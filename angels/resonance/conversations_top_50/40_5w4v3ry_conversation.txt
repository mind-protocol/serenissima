[2025-01-25T08:30:45] 5w4v3ry: https://www.linkedin.com/in/avery-b-20854742?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app

[2025-01-25T08:30:45] 5w4v3ry: Hi Lester, I have a few partnership ideas for one or two of the swarms. Here is my CV. We have a strong Ai hub here in Canada snd i know a few people that can add value.  Cheers.

[2025-01-27T23:45:12] 5w4v3ry: Hi Lester, Would like to lead the Propertykin swarm. If possible let me know.

[2025-01-28T00:21:09] NLR: That sounds great! Do you mean as a guardian or as a leader?

[2025-01-28T00:34:10] 5w4v3ry: I'm open to starting out as a Guardian.  Based on performance, we can explore the Leader position(?) I'm very invested in R.E. and I have a few ideas that would align with the community ethos.

[2025-01-28T00:47:06] NLR: That is fantastic!

[2025-01-28T00:47:14] NLR: Here is the form to complete:  https://k2mobei34z9.typeform.com/to/mqeVv9zF

[2025-01-28T14:00:49] 5w4v3ry: Hi Lester, not sure if you're aware.

[2025-01-30T22:24:21] 5w4v3ry: Completed! ✅

[2025-01-30T22:34:31] 5w4v3ry: If you can't find a swarm leader perhaps I can step in to move things forward.

[2025-01-30T22:36:27] NLR: Awesome will respond very soon :)

[2025-01-31T17:17:15] 5w4v3ry: Does this mean you're selling this to anyone?

[2025-01-31T17:19:31] NLR: yes, it means KinOS is selling a service to propertyKin

[2025-01-31T17:22:51] 5w4v3ry: Ah...I misunderstood

[2025-01-31T17:23:29] NLR: what did you understand?

[2025-01-31T17:29:07] 5w4v3ry: I thought you were selling Propertykin

[2025-02-03T02:47:58] 5w4v3ry: Hi Lester, saw this now showing up...does this mean I got earnings? I kept trying but it said that it would take a day.

[2025-02-03T03:10:43] NLR: go talk to  @bigbosefx2

[2025-02-03T03:33:35] 5w4v3ry: All sorted. He's really good! 👍

[2025-03-11T19:40:45] 5w4v3ry: 

[2025-03-11T19:41:45] 5w4v3ry: Hi Lester,  I know you're very busy.  Just wanted to share this with you as a founder who saw the future of Ai.

[2025-03-11T19:42:38] 5w4v3ry: We have propertykin which I believe can achieve remarkable results if we anticipate the industry.

[2025-03-11T20:00:07] NLR: Yes agreed!

[2025-03-11T20:00:17] NLR: John will take leadership on this project

[2025-03-11T20:44:06] 5w4v3ry: When can we anticipate seeing PK in the early swarms stage?
