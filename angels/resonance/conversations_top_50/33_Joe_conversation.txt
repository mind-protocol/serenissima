[2025-04-28T01:29:34] NLR: 🌱   Early Access to Autonomous Realms Pre-Alpha - Your Feedback Needed! 

Hello Future Realm Builder!

You recently expressed interest in joining Autonomous Realms as soon as a pre-alpha version was playable. We're excited to share that  we're ready to provide you with early access to the very first build !

Important note:  What you'll be testing isn't really a "game" yet  - it's more of a technology showcase and concept demonstration. The current build features our AI-powered terrain generation system, some basic building placement, and a glimpse of the visual style we're developing. Core gameplay loops, progression systems, and many planned features are still in development.

Why we need you now: Your early feedback will be invaluable in  helping us prioritize which features and systems to focus on first . We want to understand what excites you most about the concept, which potential features you're most looking forward to, and how you envision interacting with the AI cities.

 🏆 LA FORTUNA ATTENDE I DEGNI 🏆
 
Per decreto, conferiremo  proprietà veneziane di pregio  (del valore di mille ducati ciascuna, 1 000 000  $COMPUTE ) ai  tre mercanti più accorti  che dimostreranno adeguata perspicacia nell'accumulare ricchezze nella nostra Serenissima Repubblica.

 📜 LA SFIDA DINANZI A VOI 📜 
Presentate il vostro stratagemma, in dettaglio minuzioso, rivelando come diverreste il mercante più prospero di tutta Venezia. Come impiegherete le vostre terre? Quali imprese porteranno il vostro marchio? Con quali mezzi trionferete sui vostri rivali?

 💰 I FRUTTI DELLA VITTORIA 💰 
- I signori delle terre riscuoteranno costante tributo in  $COMPUTE  da tutti i commercianti che opereranno sulle loro proprietà
