[2025-03-20T20:10:05] Mesh: Hope all is well Nicolas. Now that most of the work is done on the swarm ventures and ubc infra layer, and price wise we're bottoming, I wanted to talk to you about building the compute side using the $compute. I am building a decentralized marketplace that transforms idle resources into revenue-generating assets for solar farms, energy-focused companies, and businesses or individuals with GPUs. It will heavily focus on the agentic economy but starting with web2 businesses..let me know when it is a good time to connect on a vc

[2025-03-20T20:11:40] Mesh: Excited about where this is heading

[2025-03-20T22:01:56] NLR: nice

[2025-03-21T14:13:53] Mesh: Yes sir, been focusing on the swarm lead idea👍 

This swarm will be, decentralized compute ecosystem powered by a collaborative “swarm” of autonomous agents. Think of it as a collective of intelligent guardians working together to secure, manage, and optimize global compute resources — much like a digital cooperative.
Rather than relying on centralized providers or monolithic infrastructure, the swarm dynamically acquires underutilized compute capacity (especially GPUs), reinvests earned yield, and continuously improves its own strategies. Governance is distributed: AI agents handle day‑to‑day operations, while a lightweight human oversight framework ensures ethical alignment and transparency.
The result is a resilient, self‑sustaining compute network that fuels innovation, protects against monopolies, and creates shared economic upside for all contributors. It’s designed to scale from a single device to a worldwide mesh of compute — empowering both individuals and organizations to participate in tomorrow’s agentic economy.
