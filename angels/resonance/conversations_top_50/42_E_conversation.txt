RECENT CONVERSATION (Last 6 months):
==================================================

[2025-01-24T18:15:26] E: Nice now one of the actual good mods we had is gone

[2025-01-24T18:15:50] E: These three mods you are paying are fucking idiots. All 3 of them are like Nigerian and understand zero context in conversation

[2025-01-24T18:17:49] E: I’m down so bad after holding and dca for months. That compute launch was so terrible I may just cut losses at this point.

[2025-01-24T18:22:50] NLR: Look, I understand the frustration around the delays - no one likes waiting, especially in this space. Regarding moderation - we choose our mods based on their dedication and commitment, not their nationality. However, if you've experienced specific issues with moderation decisions, I'd appreciate if you could share concrete examples so we can review and improve.

But regarding COMPUTE - we hit our targets, just took a bit longer than planned. The infrastructure is solid, staking is live, and our AI swarms are showing real results (check out the live demos on X if you haven't).

The delays actually helped us strengthen some of our understanding. We're properly positioned now for the next phase, which is the real exciting part - the start of swarm profit redistribution and  $UBC  burns.

Time in crypto often feels like dog years, but some things are worth building right rather than building fast. That's what we're doing here.

[2025-01-24T18:23:34] E: I appreciate the good response. I’ve seen that big bosse guy give misinformation countless times

[2025-01-24T18:23:49] E: Every time someone asks him a question his response is either completely incorrect or doesn’t even make sense

[2025-01-24T18:24:44] E: And idk why u told Rome that he hasn’t done shit. One of the best mods in there and now he’s gone

[2025-01-24T18:30:55] NLR: yeah he is on trial, and I don't think he will make it

[2025-01-24T18:31:16] NLR: it looks there was a miscommunication earlier. Rome as been a pillar for me and UBC since day one, and I feel very close to him, which is why it's affecting me so much. It looks like it sounded otherwise, I apologize this is not what I meant..

[2025-01-24T18:32:21] NLR: he is currently not responding to my messages, and I'm unsure what happened, but he is evidently very mad

[2025-01-24T18:32:46] E: Understood

[2025-01-24T18:33:34] E: He told me i didn’t do anything for the project so im good on that shit

[2025-01-24T18:33:43] E: Yea he fucked it up so bad. He has plans to recover but I’m not about to waste anymore of my life for him when he’s telling me i didn’t do anything.

[2025-01-24T18:33:52] E: I’m not sure what happened but this is what he said to me

[2025-01-24T18:34:50] NLR: Rome as been here since day 1, dedicated, supportive and all around awesome. I'm super grateful for everything he's brought to the project, and we wouldn't be here today without him

[2025-01-24T18:35:08] NLR: I don't know what triggered him to think otherwise

[2025-01-24T18:35:13] E: I agree. Hopefully you guys are able to work out this miscommunication

[2025-01-26T16:02:50] E: 

[2025-01-26T16:02:50] E: 

[2025-01-26T16:02:57] E: Do I get 10,000 compute for this correct guess?

[2025-01-26T19:56:05] NLR: it looks like you did not answer in the 3-hour window

[2025-01-26T19:56:23] E: I did answer within the 3 hour window

[2025-01-26T19:56:33] NLR: okay in this case you will ;)

[2025-01-26T19:56:45] E: Awesome thanks

[2025-01-26T19:57:13] E: 

[2025-01-26T19:57:13] E: 

[2025-01-26T19:57:20] E: I replied like two hours after you posted it

[2025-01-26T19:58:10] E: Also I can’t message big Bose about it because he blocked me lol

[2025-01-26T19:58:30] NLR: ahah why

[2025-01-26T19:58:59] E: Lol idek. He was saying some nonsense in chat and I messaged him about it and he just blocked me 😂

[2025-01-26T19:59:40] E: 

[2025-01-28T13:09:15] E: R u able to send it?

[2025-01-29T11:17:00] E: Damn bro Anthony is gone now too

[2025-01-29T17:30:24] NLR: what?

[2025-01-29T17:30:34] NLR: what do you mean?

[2025-01-29T17:37:06] E: The 10,000 compute

[2025-01-29T17:37:09] E: For the giveaway on Twitter

[2025-01-29T19:03:41] E: .

[2025-01-29T19:04:05] NLR: oh yeah

[2025-01-29T19:05:14] E: Should I send my wallet?

[2025-01-29T19:06:38] NLR: @Bigbosefx2  will take care of it

[2025-01-29T19:06:45] E: He has me blocked.

[2025-01-30T10:54:10] E: I can’t message him

[2025-01-30T21:43:41] E: ^^

[2025-01-30T22:21:55] NLR: ah yes, I think he closed his DMs for today

[2025-01-30T22:22:08] E: No he has had me blocked for like two weeks

[2025-01-30T22:22:09] NLR: We are pushing the mods to their limits (and the team)

[2025-01-30T22:22:16] NLR: oh okay

[2025-01-30T22:22:28] NLR: let me handle it then

[2025-01-30T22:22:34] E: Ok thanks

[2025-01-30T22:23:33] E: Who should I message for that 10,000 compute?

[2025-01-30T22:34:13] NLR: send me your sol wallet

[2025-01-30T22:34:40] E: 2NMmTWAuodYWahgroNMttCSGADciDpM83Vk1A4uiHfT1

[2025-01-30T22:34:42] E: Thanks bro

[2025-01-30T22:36:06] NLR: https://solscan.io/tx/2PpYm5moWVML3yY2fRfzF6j9wAGSBN5CWNuznNvsDgxXRBPYojxYB9v4dd6PKK62X7PyMPSkAuRRnavYRtpmQjtQ

[2025-01-31T15:31:32] E: Ty

[2025-02-10T00:41:55] E: Bro what the fuck is going on

[2025-02-10T00:42:04] E: This chart looks like a slow rug

[2025-02-10T00:42:14] E: Have you guys been selling ubc? I already saw that the dev wallet was

[2025-02-10T00:46:38] NLR: no we haven't

[2025-02-10T00:46:57] NLR: and the chart show sell when we we're swapping UBC for COMPUTE

[2025-02-10T00:47:11] E: Well that doesn’t really help og investors

[2025-02-10T00:47:20] NLR: true

[2025-02-10T00:47:31] NLR: amounts were low though

[2025-02-10T00:47:32] E: What is the point of swapping ubc for compute if it’s mintable?

[2025-02-10T01:46:53] E: ?

[2025-02-10T13:58:17] E: Why can’t u give me a response to this question

[2025-02-10T14:00:18] E: The overall sentiment on ubc right now is terrible? Are there any plans in the works? At this point it seems most people are just looking to break even on their investment. Barely any new buyers

[2025-02-10T14:43:54] NLR: it was to defend price

[2025-02-10T14:44:03] NLR: yes it's bad at this time for sure

[2025-02-10T14:44:22] NLR: we are proceeding with our plan

[2025-02-10T14:56:00] E: Any big partnerships or anything planned? Listings? More eyes on the project is desperately needed

[2025-02-12T10:32:13] E: Are you guys just planning on running the price down to aquire more supply as the team? This is rediculous bro

[2025-02-14T17:18:58] E: What happened to this?

[2025-02-14T17:19:13] E: Bigbose has muted a ton of people in the telegram. That’s why it’s been insanely quiet

[2025-02-14T18:48:09] NLR: I don't think he did

[2025-02-14T18:48:23] E: 

[2025-02-14T18:48:34] E: Og holders are saying he is

[2025-02-14T18:48:46] E: And I’ve noticed chat is dead. Makes sense

[2025-02-14T18:49:05] NLR: I think one of the bots is automatically muting them
