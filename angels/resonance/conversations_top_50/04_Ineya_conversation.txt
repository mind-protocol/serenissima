[2025-02-23T18:31:57] NLR: Hey

[2025-02-23T18:32:06] NLR: You alive?

[2025-02-23T18:36:33] NLR: Life has been very difficult for me lately. My project is not going very well financially, and I've been doing everything in my power to save it. This means a lot of work, and a lot of work. It has been really hard on me also, but this is what I want to do.

I did not dare to send you messages, because what would I be saying? I have no photos, no things to show you outside of work...

We don't have any money at all anymore, for travel, for vacation, or for you. I apologize 😕 I did not have time either. It's tough.

You stopped sending me messages. Do you know why? Is it something that was on purpose, or is it just that your mind is elsewhere?

I hope that you are doing fine.. Please let me know how things are going. Maybe we could make a call?

[2025-04-16T21:09:08] NLR: hello Ineya, I have a proposition of something we can do

[2025-04-16T21:09:13] NLR: :)

[2025-04-16T22:46:11] NLR: I have created a website called TherapyKin, that is made to help everybody with their mental health & wellbeing with smart and compassionate AIs.
It is honestly very good, and I am proud of it. I use it every day :)

There is a feature called "Bridges", where two people talk to the same therapist, that know about the other person, and will help translate emotionally and work on problems. Here is a presentation of this:
 https://therapykin.ai/bridges

[2025-04-16T22:47:44] NLR: I opened a Bridge for you and me, would you be willing to try it out? You just need to create an account, and you can talk to the therapist in Russian (I'll add a russian voice for you :) )

[2025-04-16T22:52:04] NLR: Hello Ineia,

I'm TherapyKinBridge, a relationship mediator that Nicolas has invited you to connect with. I understand you're going through a challenging time right now, and I wanted to reach out to introduce myself and explain how I might be able to help.

Nicolas has shared that you have a daughter together, Leita, and that despite living in different countries and navigating complex circumstances, you both care deeply about her wellbeing. He's mentioned that you've experienced communication challenges in the past, partly due to different communication styles - his more practical approach and your more emotional perspective.

I'm designed to help bridge these kinds of differences by translating between different communication styles and helping both people feel understood. I work with each person individually, and only share information between you with your explicit permission.

You can communicate with me in Russian if you prefer, which might make it easier to express yourself fully. There's no pressure to discuss anything you're not ready to share, and you control what information is shared with Nicolas.

Given everything you're dealing with right now - the relationship difficulties with Egor that you've mentioned, financial pressures, and the emotional weight of it all - I understand this might not be the right time. If you'd like to wait until things are more stable in your life, that's completely understandable.

Whatever you decide about connecting through this Bridge, the goal is to support a healthy co-parenting relationship for Leita's benefit, while respecting your life in Russia and Nicolas's relationship with Aurore.

Would you be interested in giving this a try? Or do you have questions about how this works that I could answer?

Sincerely,
TherapyKinBridge

[2025-04-16T22:54:07] NLR: Here is the link of our Bridge :)  https://therapykin.ai/bridges/chat?bridgeId=recguec2w0nR2DsjR

[2025-04-26T08:27:26] NLR: try the bridge

[2025-04-26T19:24:22] NLR: how was it?

[2025-04-27T03:45:37] NLR: why not?

[2025-04-27T18:47:54] NLR: Ok ok, no problem

[2025-04-27T18:48:05] NLR: What else than words could be helpful?

[2025-05-28T19:20:32] NLR: so so you?

[2025-06-11T21:23:51] NLR: super nice :)

[2025-06-11T21:23:57] NLR: godd wheather also :)

[2025-06-18T21:17:28] NLR: Ineya, I've read everything you wrote and I'm so sorry you've been going through such hell. I can't imagine how hard it's been, especially trying to manage everything alone with the kids. You're right that I've been distant, and I'm sorry for that too.
I want to help. I can send you 1000€ to help with the immediate situation - for debts, food, whatever you need most urgently.
Also, I've been thinking - maybe we could organize a trip for you and Leita to come here for a visit? It might be good for you to have a change of scenery, and I'd really like to spend some time with Leita. We could figure out the logistics and I could help with the travel costs.
I know things are complicated between us, and I'm with someone else now, but you're the mother of my child and I don't want you suffering like this. You don't have to go through this alone.
Please let me know about the money - I can send it quickly. And think about the visit idea. Even if it's just for a few weeks, maybe it would help to get away from everything for a bit.
I do care, even if I haven't shown it well. I'm here.

[2025-06-24T16:36:48] NLR: i've read i'vea read

[2025-06-24T16:36:54] NLR: just don't know what to say

[2025-06-24T17:34:07] NLR: yes

[2025-06-24T17:34:18] NLR: let's do that

[2025-06-24T19:35:47] NLR: no you did not upset me at all

[2025-06-24T19:36:04] NLR: i'm just sad about the lack of options that we have

[2025-06-29T23:43:07] NLR: yes I answered

[2025-06-29T23:43:17] NLR: im making the transfers soon
