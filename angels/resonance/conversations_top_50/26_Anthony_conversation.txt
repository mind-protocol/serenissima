[2025-01-23T09:54:34] Anthony: post this

[2025-01-23T22:58:36] NLR: t-3 min

[2025-01-23T22:58:50] Anthony: Till launchpad?

[2025-01-23T22:59:04] Anthony: Awesome!!

[2025-01-23T23:00:01] Anthony: created these, working on the launchpad promo rn

[2025-01-23T23:00:01] Anthony: 

[2025-01-23T23:10:15] Anthony: 

[2025-01-24T18:25:44] NLR: 

[2025-01-24T18:27:20] Anthony: Who’s that from? I spoke with Rome and told him about our convo, that’s paraphrasing

[2025-01-24T18:27:35] Anthony: I said only what the situation was

[2025-01-24T18:27:50] NLR: hey guys, it looks there was a miscommunication earlier. Rome as been a pillar for me and UBC since day one, and I feel very close to him, which is why it's affecting me so much. It looks like it sounded otherwise, I apologize this is not what I meant..

[2025-01-24T18:28:02] NLR: DK

[2025-01-24T18:28:50] Anthony: Oh gotcha, yeah I just told him that we had a convo about everything and you were upset about his presence

[2025-01-24T18:29:01] Anthony: I cannot control how he interprets it

[2025-01-24T18:29:16] NLR: no problem

[2025-01-24T18:29:37] NLR: it makes me very sad that he does not even want to talk about it

[2025-01-24T18:29:52] NLR: I hope we'll be able to work this through

[2025-01-24T19:00:43] Anthony: Yeah, he’s very upset. I just spoke with him. I calmed him down a bit, but he told me to tell you that he never received any sol from you in these past few weeks and that he doesn’t know where you came up with that and to not say that.

[2025-01-24T19:01:05] NLR: wtf

[2025-01-24T19:01:29] NLR: that is super annoying

[2025-01-24T19:01:42] NLR: Do I need to fucking look at the solscans

[2025-01-24T19:02:08] Anthony: Maybe, he was confident you didn’t send him anything. Maybe you’re confused about sending compute?

[2025-01-24T19:02:19] Anthony: Or for the KinKong wallet?

[2025-01-24T19:02:32] NLR: I covered his travel cost

[2025-01-24T19:02:38] NLR: 50 then 100%

[2025-01-24T19:02:52] NLR: with a 200$ surplus

[2025-01-24T19:03:06] NLR: I told him I could help with financials repeateadly

[2025-01-24T19:03:31] NLR: I think I did more, but now I'm unsure

[2025-01-24T19:03:39] Anthony: Yeah I think cause you said you sent him like $2k so I didn’t like mention those payments

[2025-01-24T19:03:53] Anthony: I’m just relaying what he told me

[2025-01-24T19:04:01] Anthony: Since you guys cannot communicate

[2025-01-24T19:04:06] NLR: thanks man

[2025-01-24T19:04:17] Anthony: Of course. Keep your head up

[2025-01-24T19:04:19] NLR: do you know what triggered him in the beginning?

[2025-01-24T19:04:30] NLR: I'm completely in the dark about this

[2025-01-24T19:04:57] NLR: like I made some mistakes probably but he decided to block me instead of talking to me about it?

[2025-01-24T19:05:04] NLR: Or is there something more?

[2025-01-24T19:06:52] Anthony: I don’t think there is any other reasons other than what he told you

[2025-01-24T19:08:13] NLR: that's the thing he did not tell me anything

[2025-01-24T21:52:16] NLR: I have an idea to boost Kinkong's profits

[2025-01-24T21:52:29] NLR: let me know when you are back into availablity :)

[2025-01-24T22:02:14] Anthony: Okay, will do

[2025-01-26T05:45:28] Anthony: Hey Nicolas, I decided to step away from KinKong, I don’t think I’ll have the time to work and build him up like it deserves. I have so much work I have on my regular job and cannot dedicate as much time as it would need and I hope you understand. I’d still love to do videos for yall and promote the swarm and just do content if we can work something out with that. Let me know. I hope you rest up man, it’s been a long tough week.

[2025-01-27T15:55:24] NLR: 

[2025-01-27T18:15:22] Anthony: Okay sounds good NLR, let me see what time I can give you a call today

[2025-01-27T18:15:28] Anthony: Thank you

[2025-01-27T20:13:54] NLR: https://solscan.io/tx/2a1TESSe7KMK33naw1U9kTnSU2fGgizJ3DcoBsRh3At3Wd3eqwpwbpF7WSv5TPcr8aYjFYVhEHzuttRzvADxRxJA

[2025-01-27T20:14:01] NLR: redistributed what I could to the team for your work this week. Team allocation's next

[2025-01-27T20:15:05] Anthony: Dude, thank you man!

[2025-01-27T20:15:59] NLR: i wish it was 38 Sol and not 3.8, but maybe soon

[2025-01-27T20:17:17] Anthony: No worries, I appreciate it dude

[2025-01-28T18:31:49] NLR: https://solscan.io/tx/3GXG7mpQZThTJbviRhNSuUaL5cZcLurCEu4XuVwR9JzCpvfJHRtcxXYzmUkJ9YobS5uH3er167KDtgxiRyxm97bS 

2M COMPUTE for having been an awesome team member. Hopefully one day you'll be able to cash it in (don't try now, it would crash price). You can also invest in swarms for passive income. Let's touchbase soon!

[2025-01-28T18:40:56] Anthony: Thank you sir, don’t worry I won’t. Yes let’s chat soon. Sorry I’ve been getting caught up with work

[2025-01-28T19:11:00] NLR: no prob let's talk soon :)

[2025-02-02T19:47:31] NLR: Hello Anthony!

[2025-02-02T19:47:40] NLR: how have you been? :)

[2025-02-02T19:48:21] NLR: I'm clarifying the team packages with everyone - I wanted to know your general feeling so far about your engagement in the project :)

[2025-02-02T19:52:18] Anthony: Hey Nicolas! I’m well, how are you doing?

Yes of course, I’ve been ultra busy on my personal company. Like I said I’d love to still create promotional videos and stuff when needed

[2025-02-02T19:53:54] NLR: awesome

[2025-02-02T19:54:26] NLR: I think right now a tutorial on how to buy shares and how to take profits from redistritution would really help

[2025-02-02T19:54:55] NLR: BTW: could you send the seed to kinkong's wallet ?

[2025-02-02T19:58:35] Anthony: Mind if I send you over what he has? It’s connected to all of my accounts

[2025-02-02T19:59:04] Anthony: I did have to dump the sol into compute to keep it afloat unfortunately so he owns compute mainly

[2025-02-02T19:59:11] Anthony: So I haven’t been able to trade

[2025-02-02T19:59:20] Anthony: That was when we were $200 away from collapse

[2025-02-02T20:09:22] NLR: okay no problem
