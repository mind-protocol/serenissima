[2025-07-05T23:17:21] Andy _Ax20: I can see the effort you are putting in on  $UBC  project, keep up the good work, we are here together and believe strong in the project, the energy is massive

[2025-07-06T00:19:04] Andy _Ax20: let's keep up the good energy and keep working harder to keep  $UBC  going we are based and strong more based people are coming in Lfg man

[2025-07-06T02:05:06] Andy _Ax20: bro can I say my observation? in where I think we are slowing down in the community

[2025-07-10T03:10:01] NLR: not for long

[2025-07-10T03:12:39] Andy _Ax20: My notices is that our engagement is not as much and constant, and I believe that having a constant and good raids is very important in any project, to tell other based people about the project and what's all about, to bring them in, imagine 50 to 60 people are saying different good stuffs about a particular project that can easily convince them to come in, and not just to like a post, but comment repost bookmark, and also voting is very important in a project, this is my observation.

[2025-07-11T17:07:17] NLR: I agree

[2025-07-11T17:07:21] NLR: do you want to help?

[2025-07-11T17:28:35] Andy _Ax20: Okay nice, or to make you feel relief from your work, if possible we can look for a really good team that knows what they doing that can handle almost all the activities in the community including raiding constantly and give good engagement, mod, voting and to type up the community to keep it more active

[2025-07-11T17:30:00] Andy _Ax20: Because most of the community members are not active to work

[2025-07-11T17:30:17] Andy _Ax20: I think this will help a lot

[2025-07-11T17:31:34] NLR: what would you like to do?

[2025-07-11T17:36:09] Andy _Ax20: Am always in the community supporting the raid, just that my verified x account got suspended, I can still be supporting when I verify the my account again

[2025-07-11T17:37:45] Andy _Ax20: But to continue keeping this going we need people that will help us continue raiding constantly

[2025-07-11T17:38:01] NLR: what do you understand about the vision

[2025-07-11T17:40:44] Andy _Ax20: about the project right?

[2025-07-11T17:55:17] Andy _Ax20: My vision on  $UBC  is that UBC is a project that has a lot of potential of growth that can easily send to millions mc, so to enable us achieve a lot and to see the potential in  $UBC  we need more hands and more energy to do that.

[2025-07-11T18:03:37] Andy _Ax20: and to make other based people to see the potential too and benefit from it

[2025-07-11T18:26:17] Andy _Ax20: I actually know of a really good team that knows what they are doing,  they can help handle almost all activities in the community they work 24/7 with blue x and they can give 40 to 60 engagement or even more than and get smashed in a minute and also type up the community to keep it more active, and still vote for  $UBC  constantly

They have worked on  #patriot  and  $SCOTTY  and with good results they performance was great

[2025-07-11T19:57:01] NLR: do you have the budget for it?

[2025-07-11T20:06:53] Andy _Ax20: I don't really have an idea on that,  but It will be nice if I refer you to the top head of the team he is the one in charge on negotiations and getting the team ready for work, so you guys can get in chat, and he has no problem sending you dm first, how about that?

and they are open for 30 minutes trial to see their performance

[2025-07-11T20:28:46] NLR: do it

[2025-07-11T20:36:09] Andy _Ax20: All of this is just an idea I have seen some of the communities am in are using and is working perfectly well

[2025-07-11T20:39:44] NLR: I don't need people telling me to do stufff

[2025-07-11T20:39:56] NLR: want to work for your bags? fucking do it

[2025-07-11T21:23:24] Andy _Ax20: Okay I understand
