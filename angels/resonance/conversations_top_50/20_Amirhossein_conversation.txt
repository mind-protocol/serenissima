[2025-02-06T08:45:04] NLR: We don't control price, but what is control is our effort

[2025-04-28T01:30:01] NLR: 🌱   Early Access to Autonomous Realms Pre-Alpha - Your Feedback Needed! 

Hello Future Realm Builder!

You recently expressed interest in joining Autonomous Realms as soon as a pre-alpha version was playable. We're excited to share that  we're ready to provide you with early access to the very first build !

Important note:  What you'll be testing isn't really a "game" yet  - it's more of a technology showcase and concept demonstration. The current build features our AI-powered terrain generation system, some basic building placement, and a glimpse of the visual style we're developing. Core gameplay loops, progression systems, and many planned features are still in development.

Why we need you now: Your early feedback will be invaluable in  helping us prioritize which features and systems to focus on first . We want to understand what excites you most about the concept, which potential features you're most looking forward to, and how you envision interacting with the AI cities.

 Link coming in a couple hours
