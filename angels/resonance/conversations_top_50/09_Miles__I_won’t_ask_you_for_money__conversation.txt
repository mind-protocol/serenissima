[2025-03-08T07:44:02] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Hi boss GM,I appreciate the partial payment made yesterday. I understand that paying me in full at this time isn't possible.

I want to assure you that I'm committed to this project and believe in its long-term potential. I'm willing to be patient and trust that when the project takes off, I'll be fairly compensated.

My goal is to work with you and the team for the long haul, not just for the short term. I'm invested in our collective success and don't want to be replaced by someone else.

Please don't worry about the current payment arrangement. I'm focused on delivering quality work and contributing to the project's growth.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration.

[2025-04-09T18:33:42] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Hey boss Goo-day sir.

[2025-04-09T18:34:40] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: I said to ask if the team group has been created yet, so you can add me to it thanks.

[2025-04-10T14:59:46] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: HELLO BOSS good morning.

[2025-04-10T15:50:30] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Hi Paul,
Why won't the team or mods address the issue of stakers losing 90% of their staking rewards? Does the team think that it's a good idea to show that they can just decide to take away earned staking rewards? Do you think that that instills confidence?

Take me, for example, I had around $20k worth of UBC tokens before the long market dump. It has lost a lot of value since, but you didn't see me complain about that. I understand that the market does what the market does.  In fact, I did the opposite and doubled down with another ~$20k buys of UBC. And then I staked my UBC tokens. I've been observing the further fall of UBC price, but again you still didn't see me complaining. In fact, I was thinking of doubling down again, and buying more and staking more, maybe for another ~$20k worth.

But then I found out that my *already-earned* staking rewards were just cut by 90%. Staking is a trust and confidence thing. I've already earned the COMPUTE tokens that I've earned, and the team just takes away most of those tokens. This kind of thing shakes people's confidence in the whole staking system, which is the main utility of and why people buy the UBC token. I don't think I'll be doubling down now with more buys.

What will the team do now to repair the damaged confidence in staking, and give people reason to buy UBC tokens again?

[2025-04-10T15:51:08] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Someone asked this actually.

[2025-04-10T19:27:32] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Gm boss 🌞

[2025-04-10T19:29:23] NLR: they will be back at 10x when  $COMPUTE  reaches it's 100k liquidity goal

[2025-04-10T19:39:21] Miles || I won’t ask you for money ||: Alright boss just notified him now.

 https://serenissima.ai/ 

The buying and selling of lands is not functional yet, but you can start to explore the map and see which lands have the highest daily income.

The income is simulated in this first phase, as soon as buildings are here the income will come from the renting of the building on top of your land!

You are aware that the market is constantly moving and we are constantly giving up opportunity cost by not choosing other Token or Investment asset?

Being patient, yes, we have been very very patient to wait for what Devs have been doing. But how can we be patient for longer, if simple questions can't be answered? And even project timeline doesnt exist?
