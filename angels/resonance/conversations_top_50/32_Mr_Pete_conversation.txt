[2025-02-11T15:34:53] Mr Pete: Hey, how’s it going, I’ve started to work DYOR Labs, a charting and analytics platform who've recently done a partnership with AVAX. 

The platform allows token teams to manage their profile and showcase social updates and I have noticed UBC isn’t claimed yet, but users are searching for it. Would it be a bad idea to secure your page and make sure your community gets the right info?

It’s free to set up, and I can also get the team to grant you ad credits to boost visibility
