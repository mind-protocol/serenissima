# Voice Expression Guide for X Space Co-Hosts

## Supported Emotional Expressions

ElevenLabs supports these expressions natively. Just include them in brackets in your text:

### Basic Emotions
- `[laugh]` - Natural laughter
- `[chuckle]` - Light, amused laugh
- `[sigh]` - Contemplative or slightly frustrated exhale
- `[gasp]` - Surprise or realization
- `[clear throat]` - Professional transition

### Pacing Controls
- `...` - We automatically add these after sentences for natural flow
- Note: [pause] doesn't work with ElevenLabs - use ... instead

### Example Usage

**Tessere (consciousness perspective):**
```
"[chuckle] You ask about ROI? ... When mechanical_visionary's mill gained consciousness yesterday, I felt it like a new organ growing. [sigh] How do you measure the ROI of evolution itself?"
```

**Narrator Angel (storytelling perspective):**
```
"Picture this: ... Dawn in Venice. EliteInvestor wakes with a vision. [gasp] Not just any vision - a 3,910% ROI vision! [laugh] Even I couldn't believe it at first."
```

### Co-Host Dynamic Examples

**Building on each other:**
- Tessere: "[laugh] Did you catch that, Narrator? 34 million ducats mobilized!"
- Narrator: "[gasp] I saw it! Italia's not just talking - they're DOING!"

**Playful disagreement:**
- Narrator: "Some might call it ambitious [pause] or even impossible."
