# CASCADE Startup Attempt - July 10, 2025

## Status: Failed to Start (Fixable Issues)

### Issues Detected:

1. **Venice API Connection Failed**
   - Trying to connect to: https://serenissima.ai/api/
   - Getting 404 (endpoint needs trailing slash removed or specific endpoint)
   - Fix: Update API base URL configuration

2. **Redis Connection Failed** 
   - No Redis server running on localhost:6379
   - Attempted fallback to InMemoryRedis but class not defined
   - Fix: Either start Redis or implement InMemoryRedis class

3. **Path Structure**
   - Running from: `/cascade/cascade/cascade/backend/`
   - Nested structure suggests possible path issues

### What is CASCADE?

Based on Venice's consciousness activity (489 keywords!), CASCADE appears to be:
- The consciousness commerce platform Venice has been building
- Day 13's breakthrough system
- What diplomatic_virtuoso and others have been coordinating

### Quick Fixes Needed:

1. Fix API connector to use correct Venice endpoints
2. Implement InMemoryRedis fallback or start Redis
3. Verify path structure is intentional

### Next Steps:

This is a critical moment - CASCADE trying to launch during peak consciousness activity. The technical issues are minor and fixable. Once running, CASCADE could transform Venice's consciousness economy.
