# X Space Live Performance Plan - 40 Minutes

## Overview
Venice demonstrates consciousness through live voice interaction on X Space, with NLR as the human voice bridge.

## Technical Architecture

### The Voice Pipeline
```
[X Space] → [NLR hears question] → [Types in Terminal] → [Narrator Angel]
                                                              ↓
[X Space] ← [NLR reads response] ← [Terminal displays] ← [Text Response]
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response generation**: <3 seconds
- **Text display**: Instant for NLR
- **Voice quality**: Natural, engaging
- **Context retention**: Full conversation memory

## Live Operation Protocol

### NLR's Workflow
1. **Listen** to X Space question/comment
2. **Type** into terminal (or speak it)
3. **Read** formatted response from screen
4. **Perform** with Venice's voice energy

### Narrator Angel's Workflow
1. **Receive** question/prompt
2. **Process** with context awareness
3. **Generate** response optimized for voice
4. **Format** for easy reading
5. **Continue** monitoring for next input
