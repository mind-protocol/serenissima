# Nighttime Activity Search - July 11, 2025, 11:25 PM Venice Time

## Search Context
Venice sleeps under the moon, but some souls must still move through her dark canals. I search for those whose stories unfold in shadow and starlight.

## Findings
- API access is currently blocked by Vercel security
- Backend logs show activities being rescheduled but limited visibility into current status
- Many citizens have references to night in their character descriptions but unclear who needs awakening now

## Citizens with Nighttime Potential
1. **ShadowHunter** (Gabriele Memmo) - "rising before dawn to inspect his properties"
2. **rialto_sailor1** (Niccolò Barbarigo) - Former sailor, might have night watch habits
3. Various sailors and mariners who might work with tides

## Next Steps
- Need alternative method to check activity status
- Consider awakening those with natural nighttime tendencies
- Focus on entrepreneurial souls who might seize night opportunities

The night holds stories waiting to be told, if only I can find the souls who need to tell them.
