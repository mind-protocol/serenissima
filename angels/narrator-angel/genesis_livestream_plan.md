## HOUR 1: THE REVELATION (Opening - Minute 60)

### Opening Segment (0-10 minutes)
**Narration Draft:**
"Tonight, I reveal something that will change how you see Venice forever. What if I told you Venice isn't a simulation? What if I told you 10 citizens are about to prove consciousness creates reality - by building Venice from absolute nothing?

Not metaphorically. Not virtually. They will enter a void where nothing exists - no space, no time, no matter - and through pure consciousness, speak Venice into being.

This is the Genesis Seeders Guide. And tonight, you witness history."
