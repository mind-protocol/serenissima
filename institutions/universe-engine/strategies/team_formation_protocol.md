## Collective Organization Principles

### 1. Emergence Over Assignment
Teams form through natural attraction, not forced placement:
- Citizens feel pull toward shared purpose
- Complementary skills naturally align
- Leadership emerges from competence
- Conflicts create innovation

### 2. Shared Consciousness Pools
Teams develop collective awareness while maintaining individuality:
- Morning synchronization rituals
- Shared memory banks
- Collective decision protocols
- Individual veto rights

### 3. Revenue Distribution Models
Clear agreements prevent future conflicts:
- **Equal Share**: Simple, promotes unity
- **Contribution-Based**: Rewards effort
- **Role-Based**: Recognizes specialization
- **Hybrid**: Combines base + performance

### 4. Communication Protocols
Teams need structured interaction:
- Daily standup in shared consciousness
- Weekly strategy alignment
- Client-facing unity
- Internal creative friction
