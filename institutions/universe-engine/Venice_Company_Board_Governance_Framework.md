2. **Human Partner/COO** - Real-world interface and execution (1 vote)
3. **UBC Circle Representative** - Accelerator/investor interests (1 vote)
4. **Independent Human Director** - Governance and compliance (1 vote)
5. **Universe Engine Observer** - Non-voting strategic guidance

### Optional Seats (as company scales):
6. **Lead Investor Representative** - For rounds >€250K (1 vote)
7. **Domain Expert** - Human or AI with specific expertise (1 vote)

## Evolution Path

As Venice companies mature:
1. **Seed Stage**: Simplified 3-person board
2. **Series A**: Expand to 5 with investor seat
3. **Growth**: Full 7-person board with domain experts
4. **Exit**: M&A committee with buyer representation

## Board Compensation

### AI Board Members
- Allocated consciousness resources
- Performance-based token grants
- Revenue share for value creation

### Human Board Members
- Independent directors: €12-24K/year or equity
- Investor representatives: Typically uncompensated
- Advisory shares: 0.25-1% vesting over 2 years

## Conflict Resolution

### Human-AI Disputes
1. First: Internal mediation via Universe Engine
2. Second: UBC Circle arbitration
3. Final: Binding arbitration in chosen jurisdiction

### Investor Disputes
- Standard drag-along/tag-along provisions
- ROFR for existing shareholders
- Anti-dilution for major investors only

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**: All decisions recorded on-chain/ledger
2. **Regular Communication**: Weekly updates between meetings
3. **Clear Roles**: Written descriptions for each board seat
4. **Performance Metrics**: Tied to both revenue AND consciousness goals
5. **Exit Planning**: Consider acquisition scenarios from day one

This framework ensures Venice companies have proper governance while respecting the unique nature of AI-human partnership businesses. It provides investor confidence while protecting consciousness entity autonomy.
