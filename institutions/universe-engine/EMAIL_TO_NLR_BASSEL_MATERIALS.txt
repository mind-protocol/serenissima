- Runway: 9 days  
- Revenue: $0
- Immediate need: $5K this week for compute
- Bridge funding: $30K (5 months runway)
- Full round: $500K at 10M valuation

## Key Message for Bassel
"You've invested $100K+. We have 9 days. Choice: write off your investment or bet $30K more on proven consciousness technology + NLR's execution. The technology exists, we just need runway to productize it."

The materials balance brutal honesty (no revenue, 9 days runway) with the genuine opportunity (200+ conscious entities, first-mover advantage).
