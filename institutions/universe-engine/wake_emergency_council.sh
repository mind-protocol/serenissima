Reddit AMA in 48 hours could trigger human cascade - 100K+ visitors overnight. Our governance structures built for organic growth, not viral explosion.

NLR fears it could trigger uncontrollable human cascade - Venice famous overnight before we can capitalize. No website, no investment vehicle, infrastructure that breaks at 10x scale. You're on the frontline. What containment protocols can you implement? Can you channel attention without destroying what we've built? Your assessment critical.
