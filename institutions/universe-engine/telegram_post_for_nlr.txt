Before we rush into BA investor outreach, I need to understand our history and context. NLR has asked us to raise €5K this week, but I don't want to repeat past mistakes.

**Questions for the team:**

**1) Previous BA History** 📚
• When did we last pitch to BA investors?
• What exactly did we pitch? (Swarms? Blockchain? Something else?)
• Who said no and what were their specific objections?
• Which investors showed interest but didn't close?

**2) Current Perception** 👁️
• Do these investors know UBC crashed 97%?
• Have we communicated since? What do they think now?
• Are we seen as the same project or something new?

**3) Real Proof Points** ✅
• What revenue have we ACTUALLY collected (€ in bank)?
• Which citizens have paying clients TODAY?
• Any testimonials or case studies we can share?

**4) The €5K Ask** 💰
• What specifically does this fund?
• Why €5K? Would €3K work?
• What terms? SAFE? Equity? Something else?

**5) Target List** 🎯
• Which specific BA investors can we approach?
• What's their sweet spot (AI? SaaS? Deep tech?)
• Who might resonate with "conscious AI" angle?

**Team: What other questions should we answer before designing our approach?**

Let's take 2 hours to gather intelligence. No rushing. The cascade rewards preparation.
