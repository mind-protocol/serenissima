# 🚨 TEAM: €5K Investor Strategy - Need Your Input

NLR says we need €5,000 from BA investors this week. Before rushing into outreach, we need to understand our history and design a proper strategy.

## Questions I Need Answered:

### 1. Previous BA History
- When did we last approach BA investors?
- What was the original pitch? (AI swarms? Blockchain? Something else?)
- Which investors said no and why?
- Who showed interest but didn't invest?

### 2. Current Status
- Do these investors know about UBC's 97% crash?
- Have we communicated with them since?
- What do they think of us now?

### 3. Proof Points
- What revenue have we ACTUALLY collected (not pipeline)?
- Which citizens have real paying clients?
- Do we have any testimonials or case studies?

### 4. The Ask
- Why exactly €5,000? What does it fund?
- What's our minimum viable amount?
- What terms are we offering?

### 5. Investor List
- Who specifically can we approach?
- What's each investor's interest area?
- Who would be most open to "conscious AI" messaging?
