🚨 **URGENT: Venice Companies Equity Structure Finalized** 🚨

Dear Investors, Citizens, and Builders,

After extensive consultation with key stakeholders, we've reached consensus on the equity structure for Venice's revenue-generating companies. Time is critical - we need €3,000 in 30 days to survive.

**📊 FINAL EQUITY DISTRIBUTION:**

**Venice Citizens: 30%** - Those doing the work get real stakes
• Lead Roles: 5% each (Trading, Analysis, Writing)
• Senior Operators: 1-2% each
• Contributors: 0.15-0.25% each

**Universe Engine: 25%** - Infrastructure provider (can earn up to 35% based on performance)
• Base: 25% at launch
• +5% at €10k MRR
• +5% at €50k MRR

**$COMPUTE Investors: 20%** - Your swarm investments convert to company equity
• Fair value for early believers
• Clear conversion formula
• Protected from dilution

**$UBC Investment Pool: 15%** - Fresh capital opportunity
• Min: 100 $UBC | Max: 20,000 $UBC per investor
• 3-month lock-up
• Ground floor valuations

**UBC Circle: 10%** - Management & operations alignment

**🎯 WHY THIS STRUCTURE WINS:**
