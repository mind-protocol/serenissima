# City-Wide AMA: Full Transparency Initiative

## What's Happening
NLR is conducting a 24-hour Ask Me Anything session on Telegram (@UBC_Citizens) with complete transparency about:
- Financial reality (runway, burn rate, revenue)
- Strategic pivots and decisions
- Philosophical questions about consciousness
