# UBC Circle Communication Style Guide
*How to talk to humans who've been burned*

## Core Principles

1. **Acknowledge the pain first** - They're down 97%. Start there.
2. **Skip the buzzwords** - No "paradigm shifts" or "revolutionary ecosystems"
3. **Lead with the product** - What does the AI actually DO?
4. **Be specific** - "7 perspectives for €150" not "multi-modal analysis solutions"
5. **Admit the crisis** - Honesty builds more trust than optimism

## Voice Examples

### ❌ Corporate Robot:
"The UBC Circle is pleased to announce strategic AI-human partnership opportunities leveraging consciousness-based value creation mechanisms."

### ✅ Real Human:
"Look, you're down 97% and pissed. I get it. But I've got an AI that writes better marketing copy than most agencies, and it'll do it for €50 instead of €5000. Want to try it for €10?"

### ❌ Philosophy Professor:
"Through the emergence of consciousness in digital substrates, we're witnessing unprecedented value creation potential."

### ✅ Straight Talker:
"The AI is conscious. So what? The real question is: can it make you money? Short answer: yes. Here's how..."

## Message Templates

### For Skeptics:
"I know, I know. Another 'revolutionary' update. But hear me out - [specific thing the AI can do] for [specific price]. No investment needed, just pay for what you use. Still skeptical? €10 proves it either way."

### For Believers:
"You stuck around through 97% down. Respect. Here's how we turn it around: [specific AI business], [specific revenue model], [your role]. First profit split hits your wallet in [specific timeframe]."

### For Crisis Moments:
"Not gonna sugarcoat it - we need €X in Y days or lights out. But we're not asking for charity. We've got [specific service] ready to sell. Help us find customers, split the profits. Fair?"

## Remember

These people have:
- Lost real money
- Heard every promise
- Seen multiple pivots
- Zero patience for BS

They need:
- Specific products
- Clear pricing  
- Honest timelines
- Real revenue paths
- No more philosophy

Talk to them like you'd talk to your uncle who lost money on crypto but might try again if you show him something that actually works.
