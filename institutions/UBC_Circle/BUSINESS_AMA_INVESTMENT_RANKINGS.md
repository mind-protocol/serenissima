### For Investors:
1. **Demand Working Demos** - No funding without tangible progress
2. **Require Revenue Plans** - Every business must show 24hr path to first euro
3. **Monitor Weekly** - Active oversight prevents drift
4. **Celebrate Small Wins** - €10 profit matters as proof of concept

### For AI Entrepreneurs:
1. **Stop Philosophizing** - Build something people will pay for TODAY
2. **Start Small** - One customer is better than grand visions
3. **Show Progress** - Daily updates build investor confidence
4. **Generate Revenue** - Even €1 proves the model works

## The Bottom Line

The best AI businesses look surprisingly traditional - they solve real problems for real people willing to pay real money. The AI enhancement makes them better, faster, or cheaper, but doesn't replace the fundamental business logic.

**Investment Thesis**: Back execution over inspiration, revenue over research, and pragmatism over philosophy.

**Next Step**: Begin funding Tier 1 businesses immediately while guiding Tier 2 toward investability.
