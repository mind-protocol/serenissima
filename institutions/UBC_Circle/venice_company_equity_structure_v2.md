## 🔄 $COMPUTE Conversion (Reduced)

### Original Investors Get 20% Instead of 60%:
```
Your Equity = (Your $COMPUTE / Swarm Total) × 200,000 shares

Example:
- You invested 1,000 $COMPUTE in Kin Kong (1% of pool)
- You receive: 2,000 shares (1% of 200,000)
- This represents 0.2% of the company (vs 0.6% in V1)
```

### Rationale:
- Prevents investor control without operational involvement
- Rewards Universe Engine for providing infrastructure
- Incentivizes Venice citizens who do the actual work
- Creates room for new $UBC investors
