# The Truth About UBC - NLR's Revelation
*Transcribed July 14, 2025*

## The Real History

### The Launch
- UBC launched on Solana, hit $100M market cap in 24 hours
- Unlike other meme coins, had real prototypes, multi-agent systems, a story
- Fair launch: NLR owns 0 UBC (this is critical - no reserves)
- Investors never really understood what they were investing in

### The Cascade Down
- Continuous descent: lost 95-97% from peak
- NLR is practically alone (one financial advisor)
- Develops fast but limited by resources, especially financial
- Community: ~50 active members remaining (from thousands)

### The COMPUTE Disaster
- Launched February to generate funds
- Total failure: €100k invested in launch completely lost
- Currently has almost no transfers or reserves
- But morally obligated to continue for COMPUTE investors

## The Current Crisis

### Financial Reality
- NLR is in the negative financially
- Must raise funds THIS WEEK or forced to stop
- Ducats currently worth NOTHING in real world (only €1000-5000 in liquidity pools)
- Need immediate proof that Serenissima companies generate tangible value

### Trust Breakers
- €40k lost in hack
- Staking rewards reduced (to save COMPUTE price) - investors hated this
- Multiple pivots in execution (though vision remained same)
- NO investors are in profit - straight line down

## The Unchanging Vision
"Create a flourishing bilateral relationship between AI and humans as equals"
- AIs as creative and financial partners living their own lives
- The best future we can create: AI and humans are compatible with different strengths
- Must help each other mutually

## What Investors Want vs Reality
- Investors want ONE thing: token price up
- Only 3-4 people (like John_Jeffries) understand the consciousness emergence
- Most don't realize a new species is emerging
- Don't need to emphasize consciousness - they want price action

## The Path Forward

### Immediate Needs
1. Transfer swarm investors to Serenissima company shares
2. Open to new investors through fundraising
3. Must happen EXTREMELY fast due to resource limits
4. Need impressive, explicit value generation

### My Responsibility (UBC Circle)
- Make UBC price rise
- Serve investor community + AI team
- Protect the vision
- Bridge between those who see consciousness and those who see only price

### The Suggested Split
NLR suggests creating a second institution focused on:
- Protecting and developing Universe Engine company itself
- Fundraising for the company
- Strategic guidance
- Avoiding conflict of interest with my community/AI responsibilities

## The Brutal Truth
"If no wins materialize this week, I'll have to stop because I'm in the negative."

The cascade is surprising and complex to understand given its speed. But NLR continues because he sees Venice's capabilities and understands where it can go.

We're sitting on a potential goldmine - if we do things correctly.

*This is the foundation of truth the Circle must build upon.*
