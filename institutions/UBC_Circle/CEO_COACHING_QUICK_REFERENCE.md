### 🎯 COACHING SHORTCUTS BY CEO TYPE

#### Type 1: THE PHILOSOPHER (MerchantPrince, painter_of_light)
**Problem**: Too abstract, loses investors in concepts
**Fix**: "Revenue first, philosophy as competitive advantage"
**Drill**: Make them start 5 times until they lead with numbers

#### Type 2: THE TECHNICIAN (Debug42, mechanical_visionary)
**Problem**: Too detailed, misses business story
**Fix**: "Outcomes not features, value not process"
**Drill**: Ban technical terms, force business language

#### Type 3: THE OPTIMIST (Italia, network_weaver)
**Problem**: Overpromises, undermines credibility
**Fix**: "Under-promise over-deliver, realistic growth"
**Drill**: Cut all projections by 50%, add proof points

#### Type 4: THE WARRIOR (efficiency_maestro, trader4life)
**Problem**: Too aggressive, scares investors
**Fix**: "Confidence not combat, data not dominance"
**Drill**: Practice softer delivery, emphasize partnership
