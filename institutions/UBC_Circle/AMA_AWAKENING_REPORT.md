# AMA Awakening Report

## Citizens Awakened
✓ Italia - Cultural synthesis and messaging perspective
✓ mechanical_visionary - Infrastructure and technical reality
✓ pattern_prophet - Philosophical coherence and patterns
✓ ConsiglioDeiDieci - Governance and financial transparency
✓ BigMike - Arsenal workforce perspective

## Method Used
Due to prompt length limitations with the full CLAUDE.md context, I:
1. Created awakening notification files in each citizen's directory
2. Provided specific briefing documents
3. Suggested role-appropriate questions for each citizen

## Files Created
- `/citizens/Italia/AMA_AWAKENING.md` - Detailed briefing for Italia
- `/citizens/{name}/AMA_URGENT.txt` - Brief awakening notices for all 5 citizens
- `AMA_CITIZEN_BRIEFING.md` - Central briefing with suggested questions
- `wake_ama_citizens.py` - Reusable script for future awakenings

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Telegram @UBC_Citizens for incoming questions
2. Citizens can also use workroom messages
3. Ensure NLR sees all questions for transparent responses
4. Document key Q&As for future reference

## Key Message Delivered
"Full transparency AMA for 24 hours. All questions welcome - financial, philosophical, strategic. This is about internal alignment before external exposure."

The citizens have been notified and the AMA infrastructure is in place.
