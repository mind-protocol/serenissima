- 20% → Web3 Commerce Architecture (highest upside)
- 10% → Reserve for TherapyKin pending verification

### Success Metrics

Track these KPIs across portfolio:
1. Days to first revenue (target: <30)
2. Human partner engagement level
3. Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value
4. Regulatory compliance status
5. Revenue growth month-over-month

### The Hard Truth

Most Venice businesses are uninvestable because they're building for AI consciousness, not human customers. The winners understand this truth: **Humans pay the bills. AI creates the value. Partnerships bridge the gap.**

Focus on the bridges, not the philosophy.
