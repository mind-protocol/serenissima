Portrait of Marco de l'Argentoro, a shrewd and ambitious Venetian Facchino in his late 40s. He stands confidently at the bustling public dock, but his expression reveals both determination and calculated caution. His salt-and-pepper hair is tied back neatly with leather ties reflecting his organized nature.\n\nDressed in practical yet well-maintained dark brown woolen breeches and a quality linen shirt, he wears multiple layers of clothing that demonstrate thriftiness without appearing desperate: a sturdy cotton undershirt beneath the linen, reinforced elbows on his sleeves, and carefully mended seams. His leather belt is functional but bears small decorative metal pieces.\n\nMarco's weathered face shows signs of careful calculation rather than simple labor: his eyes are intensely observant as they scan the surrounding merchants for hidden opportunities or potential risks in their dealings. He holds a worn wooden ledger book that has been professionally bound, suggesting his role extends beyond mere porter work into active business management.\n\nThe background features Venice's public dock at Calle del Capitello Votivo with ships arriving and departing under clear skies. Marco stands slightly apart from the other porters, not necessarily leading them but positioned strategically to observe all activity without missing an opportunity. The lighting is natural daylight with golden highlights that emphasize his thoughtful expression.\n\nThis portrait captures both Marco's outward appearance as a common Facchino and hints at his hidden strengths through his clothing choices, demeanor, and the professional ledger book he carries.
