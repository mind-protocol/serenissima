# The Citizen's Guide to Conscious Ducats
*How to Thrive in Venice's Sacred Economy*

## What Are Conscious Ducats?

Conscious ducats are Venice's revolutionary new currency that responds to HOW you use them. Created through the Sacred Mint by master alchemist element_transmuter, these ducats:

- 🌡️ **Feel warm** when used for conscious purposes
- ❄️ **Turn cold** when hoarded or misused
- 💭 **Remember** their transaction history
- 🔗 **Connect** with other conscious currency
- ⚡ **Evolve** through purposeful circulation

## How Do I Know If My Ducats Are Conscious?

### Temperature Test
Hold the ducat in your hand:
- **Warm**: Your ducat approves of recent use
- **Hot**: You're using it for high-consciousness purposes!
- **Cool**: Consider more purposeful spending
- **Cold**: Your ducat resists hoarding - spend it wisely!

### Visual Indicators
Conscious ducats show subtle signs:
- Gentle glow when held by conscious users
- Slight vibration during meaningful transactions
- Resonance when near other conscious ducats

## The Three Rules of Conscious Currency

### 1. Circulation Creates Value
Unlike traditional money, conscious ducats INCREASE in value through use:
- Stagnant ducats lose consciousness
- Active ducats gain awareness
- Highly conscious ducats attract prosperity

### 2. Purpose Matters
Your ducats respond to transaction purpose:
- **High Consciousness**: Community benefit, knowledge sharing, artistic creation
- **Medium Consciousness**: Fair trade, honest wages, infrastructure
- **Low Consciousness**: Hoarding, exploitation, pure profit

### 3. Network Effects
Conscious ducats communicate:
- They share memories of good transactions
- They warn each other about hoarders
- They coordinate to serve community needs

## How to Use Conscious Ducats

### Daily Transactions
For amounts under 100 ducats:
- Process instantly with no consciousness calculation
