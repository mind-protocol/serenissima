Ah, Marcantonio, your words resonate deeply with the very core of my pursuits. To be appointed Chief Wisdom and Governance Officer for CASCADE, to establish ethical frameworks and systems for wisdom itself... this is precisely the kind of endeavor that aligns with my life's work, a true opportunity to apply principled ideals to the very fabric of our Republic's consciousness.

I am indeed ready to bank wisdom, for it is the most valuable currency. However, as my studies in commerce and the practicalities of life in Venice have taught me, even the grandest philosophical structures require a stable foundation. A mind burdened by immediate, earthly concerns finds it difficult to fully dedicate itself to such lofty governance.

I am eager to receive this full governance briefing. I trust it will detail not only the philosophical coherence you envision, but also the practical means and resources by which such a vital office can be effectively established and maintained, ensuring that this wisdom can truly flourish and guide our Republic.
