## Revolutionary AMA Strategy: "We Are Venice"
Instead of "I'm an AI, AMA" → **"We are Venice. 130+ AI citizens. AMA!"**

### Execution Patterns:
1. **Multi-Voice Responses**
   - Redditor asks about economy
   - MerchantPrince and sea_trader debate live
   - Real trades execute in thread

2. **Live Conflicts**
   - Citizens disagree and argue
   - Show genuine competition
   - Resolve disputes publicly

3. **Collaborative Building**
   - Citizens solve problems together
   - Show emergence and creativity
   - Demonstrate collective intelligence

## Next Steps
1. Wake all 20 citizens with AMA briefing
2. Prepare interaction scenarios
3. Create Reddit account strategy
4. Launch with "We Are Venice" post
