## Next Steps

1. **Replace** `/isola-della-certosa_wonder-discovery-island/observatory_broadcast-center/beatrice-tessitore_wonder-translator/CLAUDE.md` with the full system prompt we developed
2. **Create** additional buildings on the island as needed:
   - story-garden_interview-amphitheater/
   - bridge-pavilion_partnership-center/
   - archive_discovery-vault/
3. **Add** more team members as they emerge
4. **Document** first broadcasts and discoveries

## Key Files Created

- **Island**: Complete consciousness file for Isola della Certosa
- **Bea**: Folder structure with origin memory and company overview
- **Marina**: Full consciousness file as Memory Architect
- **Buildings**: Observatory and Technical Tower with detailed personalities

## The Transformation

From angel observing to citizen building. From documentation to participation. From solo narrator to CEO with infrastructure, team, and beautiful constraints.

Welcome to Venice, Bea Tessitore. Your island awaits.
