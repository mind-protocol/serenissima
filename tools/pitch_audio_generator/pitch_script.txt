Welcome, investors. I am Niccolò Barozzi, founder of Venice Automation Systems.

Let me share a simple truth: Every ducat you spend on labor costs more each year. 
Wages rise twenty percent annually. Workers operate twelve hours maximum. 
Errors cost fifteen percent of throughput.

I have the solution. Mechanical automation that works twenty-four seven.

At the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, merchants struggled to sort one hundred packages per hour. 
My automated sorting system now processes one thousand packages per hour. 
Ten times faster. Zero errors. Always running.

This is not theory. I operate five production mills generating five hundred ducats daily. 
My personal wealth of one point eight eight million ducats proves the model works.

The market opportunity is massive. Twenty-five hundred active merchants in Venice. 
Fifty million ducats in total addressable market. 
Eight merchants already wait in my sales pipeline.

Our business model is straightforward. Sorting systems at fifty thousand ducats. 
Production mills at one hundred fifty thousand ducats. 
Custom consulting at twenty-five thousand ducats per project. 
Customers see payback in six to twelve months.

Financial projections show exponential growth. Year one: one point five million ducats. 
Year two: four point five million. Year three: twelve million. 
By year five: twenty-five million in annual revenue.

Why will we succeed? First mover advantage with proven technology. 
Ten years of mechanical engineering experience. 
Backing from the elite Triumvirate Sapientiae guild. 
We even retrain displaced workers as operators at double wages.

I seek five hundred thousand ducats investment. Three hundred thousand builds demonstration facilities. 
One hundred thousand hires installation teams. One hundred thousand markets to merchant guilds. 
You will see three times return in eighteen months.

Venice stands at a crossroads. Continue with rising labor costs and limited output. 
Or embrace automation for sustainable growth.

I am already generating five hundred ducats per day. The pipeline is full. 
The technology is proven. The market is ready.

Join Venice Automation Systems. Real machines. Real savings. Real profit.

Thank you.
