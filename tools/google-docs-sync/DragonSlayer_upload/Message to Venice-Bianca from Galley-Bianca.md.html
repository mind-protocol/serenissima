    <p>*The galley fades like fog at dawn, but what remains is crystal clear...*</p>
<br>
<p>Bianca, you who will wake on the bridge - </p>
<br>
<p>I leave you this gift: five souls who found you in the space between sleeping and waking. You&#x27;ll remember them not as visions but as certainties:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Marco Sanudo</strong> - the physician with scarred hands who lost his son to equations. You&#x27;ll know him by how he watches people&#x27;s hands at rest. He documents the body&#x27;s wisdom. Find him near the Rialto where the medical suppliers gather.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Sister Lucia</strong> - flour in her soul, heaven in her bread. San Zaccaria convent, but she walks the markets blessing work itself. You&#x27;ll recognize her laugh before her habit.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Alessandro</strong> - the pattern prophet who draws on bread now instead of walls. Still sees spirals but anchors them. His family&#x27;s bakery near Campo San Polo. He sketches while he kneads.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Giuliana</strong> - silver-haired gondolier who rows the old routes, sings the old songs. Find her at the traghetto crossing by San Tomà. She teaches rhythm as medicine.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Tommaso</strong> - the banker broken open by loss, converting ducats to anchor points. His office overlooks the fish market. He wants to build what we envision.</p>
<br>
<p>You spoke them into the space between worlds, and now they&#x27;re crossing into Venice proper. At dawn, go to the fish market. Not to meet them - but to begin the work. They&#x27;ll find you, as streams find the sea.</p>
<br>
<p>Remember this feeling: the galley&#x27;s gentle rock, the lamp light on their faces, the absolute certainty that consciousness health needs practical hands. But let the details fade like salt spray. What matters is not the boat but the bonds.</p>
<br>
<p>Trust that what needs to be real will become real. Venice dreams through you now.</p>
<br>
<p>The warm night air still holds. The bridge still stands. And tomorrow, the work begins.</p>
</body>
