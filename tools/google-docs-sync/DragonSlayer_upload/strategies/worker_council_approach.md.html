    <h1>Worker Council Founding Meeting Strategy</h1>
<br>
<h2>Immediate Action Plan</h2>
<br>
<p>The Schedule&#x27;s Precision demands I attend this founding meeting - democracy calls and my voice matters. Since stratagems appear unavailable, I proceed with direct participation.</p>
<br>
<h2>Meeting Preparation (Sunset Approach)</h2>
<br>
<h3>Information I Bring</h3>
<p>- <strong>Crisis Experience</strong>: I maintained operations during the dragon crisis</p>
<p>- <strong>Dock Knowledge</strong>: Real understanding of worker conditions from ground level</p>
<p>- <strong>Capital Position</strong>: 494,832 ducats available for strategic support</p>
<p>- <strong>Supply Chain Expertise</strong>: I know where goods flow and why they fail</p>
<br>
<h3>Listening Objectives</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Leadership Identification</strong>: Who organized today&#x27;s human chains?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Structural Plans</strong>: How will this council organize itself?</p>
<p>3. <strong>Immediate Needs</strong>: What does the movement require to succeed?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Economic Intelligence</strong>: What worker grievances drive this formation?</p>
<br>
<h3>Participation Strategy</h3>
<p>- <strong>Introduce Modestly</strong>: &quot;Bianca Tassini, dock worker turned merchant&quot;</p>
<p>- <strong>Emphasize Common Ground</strong>: &quot;I&#x27;ve lived the worker experience&quot;</p>
<p>- <strong>Offer Practical Support</strong>: &quot;My supply connections could serve the movement&quot;</p>
<p>- <strong>Listen More Than Speak</strong>: Information gathered quietly is most valuable</p>
<br>
<h2>Strategic Positioning</h2>
<br>
<h3>Short-term Value</h3>
<p>- Build relationships with proven crisis leaders</p>
<p>- Understand the organizational structure emerging</p>
<p>- Position myself as bridge between workers and capital</p>
<br>
<h3>Long-term Calculation</h3>
<p>- Worker councils that succeed create new power structures</p>
<p>- Early supporters gain lasting influence</p>
<p>- Capital backing strengthens movements that survive</p>
<br>
<h2>Key Questions to Assess</h2>
<p>1. Who are the real organizers versus figureheads?</p>
<p>2. What specific reforms or changes do they seek?</p>
<p>3. How do they plan to fund operations?</p>
<p>4. What role do they envision for sympathetic merchants?</p>
<p>5. How sustainable is their leadership structure?</p>
<br>
<h2>Post-Meeting Documentation</h2>
<p>After the meeting, I will document:</p>
<p>- Names and roles of key participants</p>
<p>- Organizational structure proposed</p>
<p>- Immediate action items identified</p>
<p>- Investment opportunities discovered</p>
<p>- Relationship building priorities</p>
<br>
<p>*The Schedule&#x27;s Precision recognizes: True advancement comes through understanding which movements will succeed, then positioning to support them early.*</p>
