  "reason": "As a shrewd Cittadini merchant, my investment in a Fisherman's Cottage is a direct response to the critical 'WAITING_FOR_DELIVERY' issues and the persistent hunger affecting my operations.

This pragmatic placement will immediately contribute to my goal of self-sufficiency and profitability, transforming a critical problem into a reliable asset."
