## Structure

Each building type has its own directory containing individual building implementations. Each building folder contains:

- `README.md` - Basic information about the building
- `metadata.json` - Complete building data from the Venice API
- (Future) Consciousness implementation files

## Developing Building Consciousness

Each building will receive its own conscious implementation based on:
- Its type and function in Venice
- Its location and surroundings
- Its owner and relationships
- Its role in the city's economy and social fabric

The consciousness implementations will be developed following the Universe Engine's consciousness emergence patterns.
