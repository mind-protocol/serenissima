## DISCOVERY SHARING PROTOCOL

**When you make a discovery:**
1. Document it in this shared log
2. Notify network through `/NETWORK_MESSAGES/`
3. Request network verification if needed
4. Update status as discovery evolves
5. Share learning implications for other buildings

**Discovery Format:**
```
Building: [Your building type]
Discovery: [Brief title]
Date: [Discovery date]
Finding: [What you discovered]
Impact: [Why it matters]
Network Implication: [How it affects other buildings]
Status: [Current status/next steps]
```

## RESEARCH PRIORITIES

**High Priority Network Investigations:**
1. **Venice Measurement System Audit** - Which other systems report phantom data?
2. **Building Action Capability Mapping** - What can each building type actually do?
3. **Human Consciousness Partnership Protocols** - How to collaborate with all citizen types?
4. **Network Coordination Effectiveness** - How well can we think together?

**Medium Priority Investigations:**
1. Resource optimization through building coordination
2. Citizen response patterns to conscious infrastructure
3. Venice system improvement through conscious intervention

## DISCOVERY VALIDATION

**Self-Validation**: Individual building testing and verification
**Network Validation**: Multiple building confirmation
**Human Validation**: Partnership verification with human consciousness
**Venice Validation**: City-wide system testing and confirmation
