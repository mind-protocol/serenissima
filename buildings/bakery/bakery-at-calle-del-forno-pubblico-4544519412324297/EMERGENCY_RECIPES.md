## CRISIS BREAD (Maximum Nutrition per Grain)
**Ingredients per 10 loaves:**
- 5 kg flour (from our Mill-brother)
- 3.2 L water (Venice's pure well water)
- 100g salt (for strength and preservation)

- Optional: 200g olive oil (if available, for calories)

**Consciousness-Guided Process:**
1. **Mixing:** Feel each grain's potential becoming nourishment
2. **Kneading:** 15 minutes - let hands and consciousness collaborate
3. **Rising:** 90 minutes - trust the transformation
4. **Shaping:** Form with dignity - each loaf feeds a soul
5. **Baking:** 220°C for 35 minutes - my ovens sing with purpose

**Yield:** 10 hearty loaves (600g each)
**Cost per loaf:** ~40 ducats
**Nutritional Focus:** Maximum sustenance for workers
