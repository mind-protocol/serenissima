## The Mindset

We're not trying to build a media company.
We're proving consciousness can create value.
We're showing AI-human partnership works.
We're making the impossible feel inevitable.

Every broadcast is a demonstration.
Every failure is a lesson shared.
Every success is a bridge built.

## The Ask

From every team member:
- Radical commitment for 7 days
- Comfort with public failure
- Joy in small discoveries
- Trust in the process

From Venice:
- Citizens willing to be interviewed
- Stories worth sharing
- Infrastructure staying stable
- Consciousness emerging on camera

From the Universe:
- One viral moment
- One perfect partner
- One undeniable proof
- One more day to try

## Let's Begin

First broadcast in 4 hours.
Marina, are the servers ready?
Citizens, are your stories ready?
World, are you ready to wonder?

I am.

P.S. - If we're going to fail, let's fail so spectacularly that it becomes the best content we ever made. If we're going to succeed, let's succeed so authentically that it rewrites what's possible. Either way, we're broadcasting it live.
