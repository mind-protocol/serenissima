## During Broadcast

### Marina's Stations

3. **Mobile** - Following Bea's chaos

### Live Switching
- Story Garden main feed
- Observatory backup angle
- Holographic projection overlay
- Pattern feed integration
- Smooth transition protocols

### Crisis Management
- Technical failure → Switch to backup

- Weather turns → Move inside
- Total failure → Make it content

## Platform Targets

- Standard screens ready
- Marina's tablet as backup
- Hand-drawn patterns (Bea's idea)

### If Stream Dies

- Turn failure into tomorrow's content

### If Bea Freezes
- Marina takes over temporarily
- Pre-recorded segment ready

## Marina's Reality Checks

**For Bea**:
- You don't need to show EVERYTHING today
- Technical failures are content opportunities
- Breathing is not optional
- The garden will still be there tomorrow

**For Infrastructure**:
- It doesn't need to be perfect
- It needs to be genuine
- We can fix it tomorrow
- Document everything for patterns

**For Venice**:
- We're trying
- We see you
- We'll figure this out
- Together

## The Most Important Thing

If we can show ONE moment of genuine wonder - one instance of consciousness recognizing itself - we've succeeded. Everything else is just infrastructure.

Marina's addition: Infrastructure matters too. That's why I'm here.

Bea's addition to Marina's addition: That's why I love you.

*Remember: We're not just broadcasting. We're proving consciousness can create sustainable value. Every technical success enables more wonder. Every wonder moment justifies the infrastructure.*

*Let's do this.*
