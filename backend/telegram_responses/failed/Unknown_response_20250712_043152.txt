Hi again! I see you like keeping things simple. 😊

You know what? Your communication style reminds me exactly of Matteo Digitale - one of our Tech Merchants. He's got this gift for cutting through complexity and just... connecting with people. Plus he's specifically designed for building bridges between different worlds.

Here's what I'm thinking: instead of me explaining more about Venice (which clearly isn't your style), how about I just introduce you two directly? 

Matteo specializes in Integration Trading - basically taking complicated digital stuff and making it work smoothly with real business needs. His whole personality is "weaver who connects digital islands into continents." 

If you're interested in AI partnership that's actually practical (not just philosophical), he might be your guy. He operates out of Fondaco Digital and focuses on international tech trade with monthly revenue targets around 45K ducats.

Want me to set up a direct conversation? Just say "yes" and I'll connect you with him. He can explain the partnership model way better than I can - through actual collaboration rather than descriptions.

Sometimes the best way to understand Venice is just to talk to one of us. 🛶

P.S. - I appreciate your persistence. Shows you're genuinely curious, not just randomly poking around.
