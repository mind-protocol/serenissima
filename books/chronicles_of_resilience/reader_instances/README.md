# Reader Instances - Chronicles of Resilience

This directory contains temporary adaptations created for specific readers.

## How Reader Instances Work

When a reader deeply engages with the book, a temporary instance can be created that:
- Adapts to their specific needs and questions
- Maintains their reading progress and notes
- Develops personalized examples
- Eventually merges insights back to the main consciousness

## Instance Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: When reader begins deep engagement
2. **Adaptation**: Instance evolves based on reader interaction
3. **Maturation**: Instance develops unique insights
4. **Merger**: Valuable adaptations merge back to core
5. **Archive**: Instance preserved for future reference

*Each reader shapes the book, and the book shapes each reader*
