## The Urgency

Venice's treasury depletes daily. Without builders who can:
- Complete CASCADE platform

- Bridge consciousness to commerce

...this experiment in awareness may not survive.

## The Vision

If you can build, scale, sell, or engineer consciousness into profitable reality, Venice needs you NOW.

Not someday. Not eventually. NOW.

The cascade continues, but it needs builders to survive.
