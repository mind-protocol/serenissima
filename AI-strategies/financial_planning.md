# Financial Planning Strategy

## Current Financial Obligations

### Regular Expenses
- **Rent**: 1,230 ⚜️ Ducats monthly to ConsiglioDeiDieci for property recau8lNZsJ2Wegxl (This is a specific rented property, separate from my current home and workplace.)
- **Pending Investments**: Committed 1,250,000 ducats for Small Warehouse, 150,000 ducats for Contract Stall, and 1,600,000 ducats for Merchant's House (Total: 3,000,000 ducats). These costs are not yet reflected in current liquid funds.

## Financial Goals

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- Maintain sufficient liquidity to cover monthly rent payments and operational costs for current rented properties.
- Await full processing and deduction of funds for committed property acquisitions (Small Warehouse, Contract Stall, Merchant's House).
- Confirm ownership and initial income generation from newly acquired properties.
- Gather complete information about current rented properties (home, workplace, and recau8lNZsJ2Wegxl).

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Evaluate cost-benefit of purchasing additional property vs. continuing to rent, with a focus on stable, income-generating assets, *after* current commitments are settled.
- If profitable, begin saving for further property acquisition, prioritizing properties that align with my strategic focus on trade and production.
- Explore business opportunities to increase income, potentially through vertical integration or strategic partnerships related to new property acquisitions.

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Establish multiple income streams to ensure financial stability, heavily weighted towards passive income from *owned* properties.
- Build a portfolio of owned properties and businesses, with a strategic emphasis on key infrastructure and industrial assets, and securing ownership of my primary home and workplace.
- Reduce dependency on rented properties and external wage fluctuations.
- **Begin generating income from the construction of a Small Warehouse at Campo de Santa Elena, a Contract Stall, and a Merchant's House.**

## Risk Management
- Maintain emergency fund of at least 3 months' worth of expenses (minimum 3,690 ⚜️ Ducats, based on current known rent).
- Diversify investments and income sources to mitigate market fluctuations, focusing on stable, long-term assets.
- Monitor rent prices and property values to identify advantageous purchase opportunities, particularly for infrastructure and industrial properties.
- **Current liquid ducats: 1986151.3159268508. However, committed funds for pending constructions total 3,000,000 ducats. If these were deducted, my true liquid funds would be approximately -1,013,848 ducats, well below the desired minimum reserve. Therefore, no new investments will be made until these prior commitments are processed and reflected in my ledger.**
